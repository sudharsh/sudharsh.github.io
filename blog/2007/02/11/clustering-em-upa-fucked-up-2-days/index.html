<div class="entry-content"><p>College Exibhition day is always fun. You get to make a lot of scene with whatever little knowledge you have on the subject. For this year me and my buds chose to setup a small OpenMosix Cluster rendering farm to give a demonstration of High Peformance Computing with Linux. CluterKnoppix and Blender did our work job quite painlessly but&hellip;In a way Exibhitions and Symposiums are different. Your work can bomb if the visitors dont get the concepts of your project in Exibhitions.  In Symposiums most of the guys attending know something if not all which is not so in Exibhitions.</p>

<p>Boy, did we have to search for the perfect configurations, Most of the systems were archaeic ones which didnt even have a PXE bootable LAN card. First Hurdle. Of the 4 CSE labs, 1 lab had everything except the CPUs, the other apparently housed expensive Pentium D ones, which were kept as show pieces and hence were Off-Limits. We were literally on our knees to convince the blokes to give us boxes. This left us with 2 labs, and tell you what both of them sucked. We could manage to rig up about 6 boxes which could boot through LAN, to set up our farm of which 2 were smuggled without anyone noticing. And yes our cluster did eventually work without a hitch, but we had wasted about 2 weeks to get the machines in the first place. Added to that someone nicked a webcam and a headphone from the lab in which we were working, that meant we had to do paperwork that made Visa applications look like a piece of cake.</p>

<p>In the end it was a disappointing two days, since we lost the expo which I think was not fair. But most of the staff were happy about out performance, That still remains our consolation.
I learnt a few things from this experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>Never become too technical. We just couldnt get the concepts to be implanted into the many mush brains out there.</li>
<li>For some reason the morons thought that Linux was inferior. We had to borrow a Debian Laptop with Beryl from my friend to show off GNU/Linux first and then our cluster..</li>
<li>Keep always two exibhits, One technical like the OpenMosix Cluster appealing to the technically inclined and the other for the mugbrains to drool upon. In our case Beryl + a Edited Video Song with additional special effects. (In case you were wondering it was the opening sequence from the Tamil film Ghajini). I felt people could relate well if you present them contrasting areas. In our case, Desktop and High Performance Computing.</li>
<li>Adapt to your audience. Give real world examples. For example we sited the Human Genome Project for the Bio-Tech students and staff, and the many Mathematical simulations for the Mathematics guys.</li>
<li>Be as visual as well, the GUI is better than the CLI when exibhiting. Its not the place to show off your shell skills. Show performance graphs, comparison charts et all. You get the picture</li>
<li>NEVER EVER brag&hellip;..We did that and we turned out to be a complete embarassment in the last.</li>
</ul>


<p>And to all the MORONS who mocked us. OPENMOSIX clusters arent just LANs to share your valuable data (a.k.a pr0n?), Its a way to achieve High Performance with limited resources..And YOU dont need a fucking monitor for your computer to work. Computers CAN boot without monitors.
And to the co-ordinators of exibhitions, judges with a &lsquo;nada&rsquo; knowlegde about the subject are totally not funny. They are frigging annoying&hellip;</p>
