    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not a die hard fan of Harry Potter, but still a fan of J.K&rsquo;s work. Come July 20, and the last and final installment of Harry Potter, just made my friends all excited; that the three of us woke up at 4 in the morning and went to Landmark at Spencer&rsquo;s wanting to get hold of the book first. I was riding my mom&rsquo;s dependable krystal without a license (..and she didn&rsquo;t know). We were in for a ride since there was a long queue outside the bookstore.</p>

<p>Some of the muggles, apparently had slept overnight in the cars parked overnight. We waited, solved the Puzzles and waited, had coffee, waited. Then the counters opened&hellip;Half an hour and some shuffles within the queue later we had the book. The dudes at Landmark gave us some burger, sandwich and some juice. But honestly, I would have preferred Mollaga Bajji with Tea.</p>

<p>The book begins with Snape and Yaxley reporting to Voldemort. And the ending&hellip;.?</p>
