    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than Death, losing my memory scares the shit out of me.
It makes me queasy to think that all the wonderful experiences I had, the secrets in my head, my tough times and failures can go poof; slowly or in an instant without warning.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter if its due to some fucked up illness like Alzheimer&rsquo;s or a freak accident from sheer bad luck. It is very possible that I won&rsquo;t be <em>me</em> one day.</p>

<p>The only bright side is that at least parts of my identity will live on as memories in people close to me if that happens. Coming to think of it, things won&rsquo;t be that bad after all :). As they say,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like simple things. Anything more complex more than &lsquo;simple&rsquo; is tough to deal with. Therefore it comes as no surprise that I love JSON. Heck, the entire grammar fits in a business card.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;325&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Source: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/equanimity/3763158824/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/equanimity/3763158824/</a> (by superfluity)&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/equanimity/3763158824/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2551/3763158824_e2f57810c4.jpg" alt="" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>If you take a closer look at the spec above, you will notice that the keys for a JSON &lsquo;dictionary&rsquo; should be strings. I have a feeling that programmers like me whose language-of-mass-destruction is python are likely to overlook this minor gotcha.</p>

<p>This is where it gets interesting. Python&rsquo;s json module tries to do something smart when you try to encode a python dictionary into a JSON string. In this case, all the keys are python ints.</p>

<p><code>In [3]: json.dumps({ 1 : 'Foo', 3: 'Baz'})
Out[3]: '{"1": "Foo", "3": "Baz"}'</code></p>

<p>When I decode it back to a python object&hellip;
<code>In [4]: json.loads(json.dumps({ 1 : 'Foo', 3: 'Baz'}))
Out[4]: {u'1': u'Foo', u'3': u'Baz'}</code></p>

<p>BAM! The json module silently converts all my integer keys to strings. I, for one, would have preferred an Exception to be raised instead.</p>

<p>Something like this, for example.
<code>In [19]: class F: pass
...
In [20]: f = F()
In [21]: json.loads(json.dumps({ f : 'Foo', 3: 'Baz'}))
... snip errors ...
TypeError: key &lt;__main__.F instance at 0x92b4b2c&gt; is not a string</code></p>

<p>In this case, I get the desired behaviour where a &lsquo;TypeError&rsquo; is raised. Stupid example, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>If I am missing something obvious here please do comment. This particular cheekiness of the json module caught me unawares recently. Or maybe I was wrong in expecting the decode operation to return something that is identical to the source.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the json support modules that ship with TurboGears error out if you try to return a dictionary having non-string keys from your controller methods.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>4 years ago, I joined a college which had the highest mediocrity rating among the mediocre colleges in TN. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t have good academics in my high school, so I must say I was quite fortunate to get an undergrad &lsquo;seat&rsquo; for a CS Engineering degree there. Luckily, on the very 2nd day of college, I had enough brains to come to a conclusion that my next 4 years would be spent in an Orwellian Dystopian Parallel Universe where students wore lab coats for CS Labs. (It still beats me, the purpose of a fucking labcoat in a Theoretical Computer Science Lab).</p>

<p>Engineering education in TN is as fucked up as it gets. The fact that <strong><em>Yours Truly</em></strong> will be attending his Convocation ceremony next month and getting a degree certificate is proof enough that its fucked up beyond all recognition.</p>

<p>And did I mention, there will be 50 more new colleges this year in TN alone! Fucking Pathetic&hellip;</p>

<p>Lastly,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to fitness, I am one of those nerdy couch potatoes with a rather rotund tummy. Burning away calories has become an important priority now and boy, do I miss those Lays and the local Iyengar Bakery Bun Butter Jam and Puffs. For the last week, I have been waking up early and jogging for 30-40 minutes (I also got a good pair of running shoes). Should increase the workout time as weeks progress.</p>

<p>Oh, I also got a new job :D&hellip;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever had that feeling of insignificance? The feeling that your very existence is a microscopic peanut in the grand scheme of things. By grand, I mean the <a href="http://hhgproject.org/entries/wsogmm.html">Whole Sort of General Mish Mash</a>. I am going through that right now. We are, according to our own theories an extremely smart species, yet for every answer we discover, 10 more questions creep up like one of those annoying LOLCATS shouting <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2009/03/02/funny-pictures-ohai-2/">&lsquo;OH HAI&rsquo;</a>. What the hell is the purpose of life? Why do we exist? What is our place in this infinite Cosmos (See the embedded video)? Its incredibly creepy even to think that our entire life is just a mega-complex probability equation, which most likely is too complex for our puny brains to comprehend.</p>

<p>Yeah, so basically what I am coming at is simple. Party now, Life is too short to be spent over unnecessary complications. Or in other words <strong><em>Frigging Use Python!!!!</em></strong></p>
