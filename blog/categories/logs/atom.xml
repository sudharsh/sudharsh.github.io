    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two major templating libraries for Clojure,<a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive"> Enlive</a> and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a>. Since I am not that much of a designer, I chose Hiccup for my side project written in Clojure. I liked the DSL&rsquo;s unification of code and templating; right in my comfort zone. This post is a little log on how I ended up using <a href="http://clojure.org/multimethods">multimethods</a> for organizing my Hiccup template functions.</p>

<h2>DRY in Jinja</h2>

<p>In my previous <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/">Flask</a> projects, <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/">Jinja</a> was my templating engine of choice. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> flow in Jinja templates consists of setting up a <code>base.html</code> with a common layout markup. The &lsquo;children&rsquo; would then <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#template-inheritance">&lsquo;inherit&rsquo;</a> and optionally override those blocks in their own templates.</p>

<h2>Composition in Hiccup</h2>

<p>However, In the world of Clojure (and therefore Hiccup), functions (duh!) are used to modularize templates.  For example,</p>

<p>``` clojure
(ns foobar.views
  (:require [hiccup.core :as h]</p>

<pre><code>        [hiccup.page :as hp]))
</code></pre>

<p>(defn head [title]
  [:head
   [:title title]
   (hp/include-css &ldquo;/static/css/bootstrap.min.css&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>               "/static/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css")
</code></pre>

<p>   (hp/include-js &ldquo;/static/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>              "/static/js/bootstrap.min.js"
              "/static/js/bluth.js")])
</code></pre>

<p>(defn get-page [title context]
  (hp/html5</p>

<pre><code>;; Since hiccup DSL is just code, we will just inject the
;; &lt;head&gt; right here
(head title)
;; Rest of the template
;; I'd probably have a (body..) somewhere
(body context)
;; Rest of the template
</code></pre>

<p>))
```</p>

<h2>Multi-methods</h2>

<p>In the above example, there is a chance of repetitiveness of functions like <code>get-page</code> as the number of routes increases. In most cases, there is one (or few) container <code>div</code> that changes across the templates. To avoid this, I have found using <a href="http://clojure.org/multimethods"><code>multimethods</code></a> to be a great way of dispatching templates at runtime.</p>

<p>For instance,</p>

<p>``` clojure</p>

<p>(defmulti container :template :default :not-found)</p>

<p>(defmethod container :home [context]
 [:h2 &ldquo;Welcome to the Bluth Company&rdquo;]
 [:button#queue-button.btn.btn-info &ldquo;Backup&rdquo;])</p>

<p>(defmethod container :users [{:keys [query-params]}]
 [:h2 (str query-params)])</p>

<p>(defmethod container :not-found [context]
 [:h2 &ldquo;Generic Content&rdquo;])</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now that I have a group of &lsquo;container&rsquo; divs, I can invoke them from <code>get-page</code> like so,</p>

<p>``` clojure</p>

<p>(defn get-page [{:keys [title]</p>

<pre><code>         :or {title "Bluth Co. - Welcome"}
         :as context }]
</code></pre>

<p>  (hp/html5
   (head title)
   [:body</p>

<pre><code>[:div#wrap
 [:div.container
  ;; Invoke container here
  ;; and dispatch the right template function
  (container context)
  ]]]))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my <code>routes</code> will end up looking something like this,</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET &ldquo;/&rdquo; [] (get-page { :template :home }))
  ;; Due to the destructuring in get-page,
  ;; I can pass in arbitrary context to be handled by
  ;; the container multimethods. In this case, we
  ;; are passing in the query-params
  (GET &ldquo;/users&rdquo; [&amp; query-params] (get-page</p>

<pre><code>                                   {:title "User list"
                                    :template :users
                                    :query-params query-params}))
</code></pre>

<p>  (route/not-found (get-page</p>

<pre><code>                {:title "Pluto - Not found!"
                 :template :not-found}))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As you can see, <code>get-page</code> is the point of entry for my templates and the container <code>div</code> is injected according to the dispatched function. In fact, by abusing using <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Destructuring-Syntax">compojure&rsquo;s</a> route destructuring, we can have true runtime dispatching of templates!</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET &ldquo;/foo/:template [template]</p>

<pre><code> ;; We don't know which container will be invoked until runtime
 ;; Instead of adding more routes, I can just add more multimethods
 (get-page {:template template})))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><code>get-page</code> function isn&rsquo;t going to change much and I can mix and match templates as much as I want.</p>

<p>I must admit that I am super new to Clojure. Therefore I am not sure if this approach is idiomatic enough in the Clojure world. Would love to hear suggestions on how it is usually done.</p>

My dad wanted to go to Kerala and catch up with a few of his college buddies and Me, I wanted to visit the lanes and streets of Calicut where I had roamed as a very little boy. After all, I had lived there for 8 years and Kozhikode hasn&rsquo;t changed a lot to be honest, except for fresh coats of paints. A new building here and there, one or two demolished. But most of my favorite spots still remain, PaiCo, Alakapuri, Lions park, my school :D, the local chips store, the &lsquo;samooham&rsquo;, winding lanes of chalapuram..etc..</p>

<p>The best part is, I met my LKG class teacher out of sheer luck. Woot, its been 14 years and still she remembers me :D (I must have been very very &lsquo;notorius&rsquo;), After all she had the patience to teach me that &lsquo;C&rsquo; follows &lsquo;B&rsquo;&hellip;..</p>

    <updated>2008-10-20T23:07:26+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://sudharsh.github.io/blog/2008/10/20/fsod-status</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its been a while since I blogged about odeviced. In my earlier posts I had mentioned the possibility of integrating odeviced and others (which do not exist at the moment) into a single daemon for avoiding too much fracture. I have pushed some code that does this, converting odeviced into a Device subsystem that is loaded by a master daemon called fsod. This, of course is very similar to the python implementation (<a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=framework.git;a=summary">frameworkd</a>) which is pretty awesome at what it does and has become a sort of success story for using DBus as the fudgy layer separating toolkits and the underlying systems which in themselves are tightly coupled.</p>

<p>The current code base is written in <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">vala</a> (and C where it is required) which unfortunately lacks certain features of <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/">DBus</a> like async callbacks and some method signatures at the moment (I may be horribly wrong. I would be glad if someone points out in that case. The mailing list discussion on async support <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/vala-list/2008-October/msg00057.html">here</a>). But at the same time, writing GObject code in vala is infinitely easier and lots of fun too :D.</p>

<p>It would be also be pretty awesome if fsod could support loading python plugins, kind of like what gedit does. The GSM code especially could benefit from this since there is not much to gain in terms of performance here.</p>

<p>As for fsod, the sources are available <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=summary">here</a>. In case anyone wants to get hold of a opk of the current code to install on the Freerunner, it is available <a href="http://sudharsh.mukt.in/fsod-preview_armv4t.opk">here</a>. Comments are welcome</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days gone by, and endless wrestling with git wherein I was not able to push code. Turned out, I was using the wrong URL to push ..doh!</p>

<p>But anyway, the <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=summary">code</a> is beginning to stabilise a bit (Read no unexpected segfaults, only expected ones..). The last few days were spent in changing the method names in accordance with OTAPI naming conventions after my mentor went through my code.</p>

<p>There is also another important change. The sysfs nodes for backlight and power plugins were hardcoded in their configuration files. So, I came up with some helpers that creates DBus paths automatically based on the device class which they belong to. Here&rsquo;s a picture of today&rsquo;s code in action,</p>

<p><a href="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/screenshot1.png"><img class="center" src="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/screenshot1.png?w=512"></a></p>

<p>Notice the <a href="https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/d-feet/">d-feet DBus</a> debugger towards the lower left? It shows all the automatically created DBus object paths based on the device class which the plugin stands for. And the terminal to the right shows some debug messages. Note how odeviced spits out the current battery status viz. &ldquo;Charging, Discharging&rdquo;. The corresponding &ldquo;battery-status-changed&rdquo; DBus signal is emitted as well (along with &ldquo;low-battery-warning&rdquo; signal which <em>ahem</em> is emitted when battery is low).</p>

    <updated>2008-06-05T18:09:23+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://sudharsh.github.io/blog/2008/06/05/battery-plugin-and-more</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a little chat with <a href="http://www.vanille-media.de/site/index.php/blog/">mickeyl</a>, I realised that exposing crucial functions like load() and unload() was not that of a good idea considering how <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=summary">odeviced</a> is supposed to closely interact with the underlying devices. Consequently there has been some changes over the last week,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No DBus interface for the service.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins have now access to a set of helper functions. Only two at the moment (Think setting up DBus object paths)</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins once loaded become resident, that is they cannot be unloaded. If plugins are to be disabled during startup, just remove them from the &ldquo;enable&rdquo; field in the global configuration file.</p></li>
<li><p>Per plugin configuration. Each plugins now have their own configuration. Makes more sense, since this mean plugins can have greater freedom with their settings. I really like how the newly checked in <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=tree;f=odeviced/plugins/backlight;h=cf890037a9a39f4a801ea9e5984c40af8440fa03;hb=e21a88cf6a35d9ef43a3d0836be26bdae733d670">battery plugin</a> exploits this.</p></li>
<li><p>Freshly checked in battery plugin. Makes use of sysfs for its functions viz. get_current_brightness, set_brightness, get_maximum_brightness.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs">SysFS</a> (/sys in 2.6.x.x) is sort of similar to the /proc filesystem and acts as an interface for user-space applications to control/access various devices. One of the neat things about sysfs is the fact that all files consist of only a <strong>single</strong> entry. This means I don&rsquo;t have to write a separate parser to extract data from them. So a simple fprintf or fscanf or even the seemingly mundane &ldquo;echo&rdquo; can be used to control the devices.</p>

<p>I am also planning to work on the python shell for odeviced for a while. This will be really convenient for testing the service. Something like this,</p>

<p><code>&gt; Wifi is_on wlan0
True
</code></p>

<p>The code can be checked out from <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=summary">here</a>. I can&rsquo;t wait till I get hold of a FreeRunner to test odeviced out. :)</p>
