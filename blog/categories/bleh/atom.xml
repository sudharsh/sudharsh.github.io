    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>4 years ago, I joined a college which had the highest mediocrity rating among the mediocre colleges in TN. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t have good academics in my high school, so I must say I was quite fortunate to get an undergrad &lsquo;seat&rsquo; for a CS Engineering degree there. Luckily, on the very 2nd day of college, I had enough brains to come to a conclusion that my next 4 years would be spent in an Orwellian Dystopian Parallel Universe where students wore lab coats for CS Labs. (It still beats me, the purpose of a fucking labcoat in a Theoretical Computer Science Lab).</p>

<p>Engineering education in TN is as fucked up as it gets. The fact that <strong><em>Yours Truly</em></strong> will be attending his Convocation ceremony next month and getting a degree certificate is proof enough that its fucked up beyond all recognition.</p>

<p>And did I mention, there will be 50 more new colleges this year in TN alone! Fucking Pathetic&hellip;</p>

<p>Lastly,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever had that feeling of insignificance? The feeling that your very existence is a microscopic peanut in the grand scheme of things. By grand, I mean the <a href="http://hhgproject.org/entries/wsogmm.html">Whole Sort of General Mish Mash</a>. I am going through that right now. We are, according to our own theories an extremely smart species, yet for every answer we discover, 10 more questions creep up like one of those annoying LOLCATS shouting <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2009/03/02/funny-pictures-ohai-2/">&lsquo;OH HAI&rsquo;</a>. What the hell is the purpose of life? Why do we exist? What is our place in this infinite Cosmos (See the embedded video)? Its incredibly creepy even to think that our entire life is just a mega-complex probability equation, which most likely is too complex for our puny brains to comprehend.</p>

<p>Yeah, so basically what I am coming at is simple. Party now, Life is too short to be spent over unnecessary complications. Or in other words <strong><em>Frigging Use Python!!!!</em></strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last few weeks, my productivity has dipped to an all time low. <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/">Progit</a> is to be blamed. Suddenly I find myselves hitting refresh to see what&rsquo;s &lsquo;hot&rsquo; leading to more time reading blogs and articles, and less time actually getting some work done. So, from this point on I am activating a self-imposed ban on progit.</p>

<p>Lets see how long I last urge :D.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Bleh&hellip;. Gave up, ban lasted 12 minutes</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Legolas Greenleaf long under tree</p>

<p>In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea!</p>

<p>If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,</p>

<p>Thy heart shall rest in the forest no more."</p></blockquote>

<p>My favorite character from Lord of the Rings. Not as good as the <a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Image:Legolas1.jpg">original</a>, but I drew these after a very long time.. :)</p>

<p>I also felt like creating a <a href="http://sudharsh.deviantart.com/">deviant</a> profile for myself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I will be entering final year in a couple of months and this means&hellip;PLACEMENTS!!! yay! (..or the lack of it)</p>

<p>This means more &ldquo;Mock Interviews Sessions&rdquo; and &ldquo;GDs&rdquo; to &ldquo;empower&rdquo; engineering students to get placed in the only 3 software companies that exist in this physical Universe. Infosys, TCS and CTS (Apparently our college is too dumb for <em>hybrid </em>corporates like m$).</p>

<p>And this <a href="http://pravunplugged.blogspot.com/2005/03/mock-interview.html">blog post</a> sort of sums up my thoughts. Highly hilarious, rolled on the floor injuring my <em>mutti.</em></p>

<p>Especially at this,</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Any actual work experience?
Buying groceries for my neighbour who has this pretty daughter called Gayathri.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Oh, yeah! I can empathize.</p>
