    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than Death, losing my memory scares the shit out of me.
It makes me queasy to think that all the wonderful experiences I had, the secrets in my head, my tough times and failures can go poof; slowly or in an instant without warning.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter if its due to some fucked up illness like Alzheimer&rsquo;s or a freak accident from sheer bad luck. It is very possible that I won&rsquo;t be <em>me</em> one day.</p>

<p>The only bright side is that at least parts of my identity will live on as memories in people close to me if that happens. Coming to think of it, things won&rsquo;t be that bad after all :). As they say,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Minor spoilers ahead</strong></p>

<p>Like many others I love <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">Shawshank Redemption</a>. The scene where Brooks is out of prison and is unable to catch up with the world is just plain sad. One of my favorite all time movie scenes that gives me the chills every time.</p>

<p>I keep hoping Brooks found his Freedom.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had been itching to go on a motorbike roadtrip to Kerala. Sitting in the back of the car isn&rsquo;t exactly my idea of a fun and fulfilling roadtrip.</p>

<p>Therefore from Oct 2 &ndash; 10, I was on my motorbike riding through some diverse terrain and landscapes that included arid countrysides, coastal plains, villages, forests, hill stations and plantations of cardamom, sandalwood, rubber and tea.</p>

<p>The 2118 odd kilometers was done on my little 150cc Yamaha FZ16 laden with saddle bags and supplies. Given a chance, I&rsquo;d gladly re-do the same roadtrip again on a more powerful machine.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_379&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;The Short Way Round &ndash; The route&rdquo;]<a href="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/screenshot-111.png"><img src="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/screenshot-111.png" alt="" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>My itinerary for the trip was as follows</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Oct 2, Sat:</strong> Home &ndash; Salem &ndash; Avinashi &ndash; Coonoor</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct 3, Sun:</strong> Coonoor &ndash; <em><em>crash in the mountains</em></em> &ndash; Ooty &ndash; Gudalur &ndash; Sultan Bathery (Wayanad)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct 4, Mon</strong>: Sultan Bathery &ndash; Kalpetta &ndash; Calicut</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct 5, Tue:</strong> Calicut &ndash; Thrissur &ndash; Chalakudi &ndash; Athirappally/Vazhachal falls</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct 6, Wed:</strong> Athirapally &ndash; Unknown shortcut through rubber plantations &ndash; Kaladi &ndash; Muvattupuzha <em>(Rendezvous with my friends here and was no longer alone)</em> &ndash; Munnar</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct 7, Thur</strong>: Munnar &ndash; Marayoor &ndash; Chinnar &ndash; Offroading at Anaimudi &ndash; Munnar</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct 8, Fri:</strong> Munnar &ndash; Idukki &ndash; Elapara (with lots of detours taking us to awesome spots)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct 9, Sat:</strong> Elapara &ndash; Vagamon &ndash; Parunthumpara &ndash; Pambanar <em>(Goodbyes over a heavy lunch and was all alone again)</em> &ndash; VandiPeriyar &ndash; Kumily &ndash; Theni &ndash; Madurai</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct 10, Sun:</strong> Madurai &ndash; Trichy &ndash; Home</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It was a long, wet weekend with rains lashing through Kerala rather heavily. Nevertheless, I was having lots of fun except for the crash in the mountains near Ooty. That was not fun AT ALL. Detailed logs to follow soon.</p>

<p>Made an unplanned roadtrip to Pondicherry on my FZ yesterday. Driving on the ECR with the sunset on your right is pure bliss. The weather was good with occasional chilly bursts of sea breeze. Cruised the entire stretch at a comfortable 80km/hr.</p>

<p>Although not as long as my earlier <a href="http://sudharsh.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/road-trip-to-yelagiri/">Yelagiri</a> trip, it was fun nevertheless. The former French colony seems to be at its best charm when it rains :D.</p>

<p>It is amazing how your senses become tuned to the road after riding for an hour or two. Hopefully, I will be doing far more longer trips this winter.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>4 years ago, I joined a college which had the highest mediocrity rating among the mediocre colleges in TN. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t have good academics in my high school, so I must say I was quite fortunate to get an undergrad &lsquo;seat&rsquo; for a CS Engineering degree there. Luckily, on the very 2nd day of college, I had enough brains to come to a conclusion that my next 4 years would be spent in an Orwellian Dystopian Parallel Universe where students wore lab coats for CS Labs. (It still beats me, the purpose of a fucking labcoat in a Theoretical Computer Science Lab).</p>

<p>Engineering education in TN is as fucked up as it gets. The fact that <strong><em>Yours Truly</em></strong> will be attending his Convocation ceremony next month and getting a degree certificate is proof enough that its fucked up beyond all recognition.</p>

<p>And did I mention, there will be 50 more new colleges this year in TN alone! Fucking Pathetic&hellip;</p>

<p>Lastly,</p>
