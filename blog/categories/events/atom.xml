    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four words. <a href="http://www.shaastra.org/2008/">Shaastra</a> &lsquo;08 was frigging awesome. I was there a couple of days and had fun meeting people (shres, madhusudhan and many others). Also got to speak about FSO framework (slides later) as part of the FOSS sub-conference. Lots of food, some awesome talks and a wonderful atmosphere made the event memorable. Too bad, I had to leave early for the FOSS HackFest on 2nd night.</p>

<p>Only one gripe though, the event was not laptop friendly =(, It would have been awesome if the organizers had provided wifi spots near the talk venues.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://kstars.wordpress.com/">kstars</a>, <a href="http://arunchaganty.wordpress.com/">vimzard</a>, vikram and other volunteers for organizing the event .</p>

<p>In Chennai we have three seasons, summer (nov-march), f***ing hot summer (april &ndash; june), a mildly wet but still hot summer (july-oct). In case you are wondering where I am pointlessly heading to, I was talking about the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code 2008</a> which ended successfully for me :D; the code which I submitted was only about 56KB which means I was the laziest among the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/openmoko/about.html">9 other GSoC'ers</a> for <a href="http://www.openmoko.com">Openmoko</a>. On the whole, I think Openmoko had a wonderful SoC this year.</p>

<p>I will continue working on the freesmartphone.org initiative and do my little bit to help around. I was planning to release the ipks along with FSO milestone 3, but it turned out that my build tree wouldn&rsquo;t let me to do that without a fight (at `NOTE: Running task 256 of 718' now), will post the link once I have the packages. Get it <a href="http://sudharsh.mukt.in/odeviced_0.1-r0_armv4t.opk">here</a>. (Thanks to mukt.in team for hosting it)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">Software Freedom Day</a> will be celebrated worldwide on September 20 (third saturday of September) and the <a href="http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc">ILUG-C</a> gang will be there at Kamban Engineering College, Thiruvannamalai this year. So if you are in Chennai at that time and want to do something fun for the weekend, please volunteer!.</p>

<p>P.S: I am planning to give away my Freerunner for free, first to comment this post gets it..</p>

<p>..NOT!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Been long since I blogged. Not feeling lazy or something, but been kinda busy.</p>

<p>First stop, we had a 5 day trip to Kerala with my college buddies. Was nice to go back to a place which I once called home. I still dont know why my friends didnt like the banana bajjis  and the big rice there. The tour was fun although I came home with a bad cold. Flickr snaps <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7611195@N06/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next thing, symposium preparations for my department are in full swing. Its been named Infovista much to my chagrin. The site is online at <a href="http://www.infovista.in">http://www.infovista.in</a>. The site is drupal powered and hosting is sponsored my #l-i buddy, jace.</p>

<p>Oh, and NRCFOSS has sponsored us a neo. We have been billed, waiting for the baby to reach us..:D</p>
