  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, here I am writing from kushal&rsquo;s place with my friend&rsquo;s lappy with wireless internet.</p>

<p>Barcamps<a href="[Barcamp.org](http://www.barcamp.org/)">1</a> are a way for people to unwind with technical stuff, with massive amounts of knowledge being shared among the participants. Barcamp 3 this year was my first conference..er unconference outside Chennai. Mom and Dad were reluctant at first especially about accommodations and stuff, but agreed once kushal let me stay with him for the event.</p>

<p>Booked train tickets for friday afternoon which was boring as hell..The fact that I had a dry book to keep me company only made it worse. Reached Bangy at about 1940, apparently 4 o minutes late, had an auto for 20 bucks to kushal&rsquo;s place..and almost immediately we started playing around with our lappies..Check out the photos at flickr. Had a nice sleep in an adjacent room as well..</p>

<p><strong>DAY 1:</strong></p>

<p>IIM Bangalore, the venue for the event was some 25-30 minutes from home by bike. Boy, the campus was one sexy piece of work..rustic, modern with exposed stone walls that gave an old minimalistic perspective to the campus. The speakers pinned their talks in the notice board themselves; The participants get to decide about the schedule by themselves. Did struggle to get Wifi working on my lappy..But in the end I was missing restricted modules, A nice dude downloaded the packages for me and after half an hour or so I was connected. Tuxmaniac turned out for the event as well. The rest of the day was spent on attending sessions, meeting some people and basically networking. The session about Socialnets and Widgets were quite good at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Day2 coming up</p>

<p>Dont forget to check out the pics <a href="[Photos">2</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>College Exibhition day is always fun. You get to make a lot of scene with whatever little knowledge you have on the subject. For this year me and my buds chose to setup a small OpenMosix Cluster rendering farm to give a demonstration of High Peformance Computing with Linux. CluterKnoppix and Blender did our work job quite painlessly but&hellip;In a way Exibhitions and Symposiums are different. Your work can bomb if the visitors dont get the concepts of your project in Exibhitions.  In Symposiums most of the guys attending know something if not all which is not so in Exibhitions.</p>

<p>Boy, did we have to search for the perfect configurations, Most of the systems were archaeic ones which didnt even have a PXE bootable LAN card. First Hurdle. Of the 4 CSE labs, 1 lab had everything except the CPUs, the other apparently housed expensive Pentium D ones, which were kept as show pieces and hence were Off-Limits. We were literally on our knees to convince the blokes to give us boxes. This left us with 2 labs, and tell you what both of them sucked. We could manage to rig up about 6 boxes which could boot through LAN, to set up our farm of which 2 were smuggled without anyone noticing. And yes our cluster did eventually work without a hitch, but we had wasted about 2 weeks to get the machines in the first place. Added to that someone nicked a webcam and a headphone from the lab in which we were working, that meant we had to do paperwork that made Visa applications look like a piece of cake.</p>

<p>In the end it was a disappointing two days, since we lost the expo which I think was not fair. But most of the staff were happy about out performance, That still remains our consolation.
I learnt a few things from this experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>Never become too technical. We just couldnt get the concepts to be implanted into the many mush brains out there.</li>
<li>For some reason the morons thought that Linux was inferior. We had to borrow a Debian Laptop with Beryl from my friend to show off GNU/Linux first and then our cluster..</li>
<li>Keep always two exibhits, One technical like the OpenMosix Cluster appealing to the technically inclined and the other for the mugbrains to drool upon. In our case Beryl + a Edited Video Song with additional special effects. (In case you were wondering it was the opening sequence from the Tamil film Ghajini). I felt people could relate well if you present them contrasting areas. In our case, Desktop and High Performance Computing.</li>
<li>Adapt to your audience. Give real world examples. For example we sited the Human Genome Project for the Bio-Tech students and staff, and the many Mathematical simulations for the Mathematics guys.</li>
<li>Be as visual as well, the GUI is better than the CLI when exibhiting. Its not the place to show off your shell skills. Show performance graphs, comparison charts et all. You get the picture</li>
<li>NEVER EVER brag&hellip;..We did that and we turned out to be a complete embarassment in the last.</li>
</ul>


<p>And to all the MORONS who mocked us. OPENMOSIX clusters arent just LANs to share your valuable data (a.k.a pr0n?), Its a way to achieve High Performance with limited resources..And YOU dont need a fucking monitor for your computer to work. Computers CAN boot without monitors.
And to the co-ordinators of exibhitions, judges with a &lsquo;nada&rsquo; knowlegde about the subject are totally not funny. They are frigging annoying&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Forget the emacs vs vi (or vim) battles.</p>

<p>Vim has tabs in its latest 7.0 release. Quite simple actually. A new tab is as easy as doing a</p>

<p><code>:tabnew "filename"</code></p>

<p>Moving between tabs is easy too..</p>

<p><code>:tabp</code>
<code>:tabn</code></p>

<p>for moving to the previous and the next tab respectively</p>

<p>For closing the tab</p>

<p><code>:tabclose "wahtever"</code></p>

<p>Heres a neat thing I learnt from the Inter-Web. You can map the &ldquo;tabn&rdquo; and &ldquo;tabp&rdquo; to keyboard shortcuts. For this open you .vimrc (..or create one if it doesnt exist), and add this,</p>

<p><code>nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;C-n&gt; :tabnext&lt;CR&gt;</code>
<code>noremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;C-p&gt; :tabprevious&lt;CR&gt;</code></p>

<p>Long live, the cult of vi&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, one of my friends turned up today with his new moto v3i asking for help..Pretty simple, put music in his mobile and make it accessible through itunes software bundled with v3i.</p>

<p>With a sense of confidence I connected it to my box, and voila it was detected as a Mass Storage Device. He gave me the CDs that came with his mobile. I gave him a smirk in return and said &ldquo;This is Linux..Linux doesnt need any steenking windows driver cd&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I copied some songs over his mobile in the itunes folder. But no songs in itunes. After scratching my head for a while, I decided to give gtkpod a shot..So fired uo my trusty shell and did a &ldquo;emerge gtkpod&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In gtkpod in &ldquo;Edit iPod Properties&rdquo;, i selected the device as xmobile, connected the mobile and this time syncing the music worked&hellip;</p>

<p>He is now probably wondering whether to give gentoo a go..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gentoo is cursed..Heres how..You use it once, feel that its not worth your time, start using debian or ubuntu only to return back to gentoo..Ubuntu and debian were tooo perfect and generic on my computer, and that too i used Debian sid. Well alright, I might sound like a fanboy, but honestly gentoo is something you should give a shot..Gentoo and Debian have lots in common.
Portage, probably on par with with Debian Package Management used in Debian, Ubuntu.etc appealed to me since the whole package management part is written in Python and bash. If you find Python interesting Portage is something to look out for.</p>

<p>I installed gentoo from the live cd but didnt choose to install any of the components except a working shell without X. Then did an emerge &mdash;sync and lo&hellip;download time. I guess the classic &ldquo;2 day compilation&rdquo; stories dont apply in modern computers. I started installing in midnight and the next day I had a working system with KDE. Note that I didnt install kde-meta virtual package which pulls in everything kde..Only things I wanted, I installed..No stupid services making my box to crawl, just plain minimalistic stuff I know I wanted. Thats the magic about gentoo and debian. YOU are under control of your system.</p>

<p>USE flags are a great concept too. Although there were no noticable speed increases in smaller apps, bigger guys like Firefox did seem snappier, although I am not sure if its just an illusion. One thing is certain, maintaining a gentoo box is loads easier than Debian even if it takes time to install from source. Another thing to note that latest packages get into the gentoo repositories quite soon after the upstream versions are released, something not common in debian world (atleast the stable release).</p>

<p>Gentoo is versionless too..with common command &ldquo;emerge -uND world&rdquo; you have a fresh new system full of latest softwares. CD releases are just snapshots of the package tree at that instant. For example I dont have to reinstall again when the next version 2007.0 comes out at the end of this month.</p>

<p>And the number one reason to try out gentoo&hellip;.Its the community. The Forums and the irc channel at #gentoo are full of friendly people who are happy to help.</p>

<p>In the end, Debian and Gentoo appeals to me because they IMO, are pure community distros with similar ideologies and policies towards OSS..I have never quite gotten myself to like other distros with a commercial backing, with ubuntu being an exception. So if you have time, do install gentoo, Its fulfilling. They have a rocking documentation, friendly community and dare I say, a package management system that puts the RPM based ones to shame.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went to kurukshetra o6 conducted by CEG today, It all started from a phone call from my close friend to have some fun there..We did!!</p>

<p>Anyways today was a Open Quiz, which I means everyone can participate. The prelims had questions which extracts juice from your grey matter and short circuits it..We did manage around 7-8 (totally embarassing) questions right. The finals had all the familiar quizzers battling against each other. (VV Ramanan, for one)</p>

<p>2 hours of intense quizzing was ..simply awesome. Although, poor Oscar Wilde was dragged in for all the wrong reasons which added colour and insanity to the event. Simply put, he was gay&hellip;Check the wikipedia article about him.</p>

<p>The OPC has been postponed to 14th, have told the organizers to send me the cash already..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>BSNL has claimed that they will upgrade all the 256k connections to 2mbps..Juicy&hellip;</p>

<p>One thing puzzling me though is the fact that I have a 900UL connection. Anyone with some other plan with a 2 Mbps connection has to be mental&hellip;..For example, 500 bucks per month entitles you for a free 1024 mb usage&hellip;2 Mbps with 1024megs is nothing. If you are applying for a BSNL connection, stay clear out of this plan. Its puny&hellip;For example,</p>

<p>256 kbps =  32 kBps (B &ndash;> Bytes, b &ndash;> bits, this is what everyone advertise)&hellip;</p>

<p>So..Lets suppose you download a big file for an hour..In an hour there are 60 minutes and hence 60 * 60 = 3600 sec&hellip;So if you were to download something for an hour you would have downloaded 3600*32 =  115200 kBs or 115.2 MBs&hellip;.This is for 1 hour with a 256 kbps..So around some 9 hours you are done&hellip;.Yeah but of course you still have those night unlimited slots&hellip;.</p>

<p>Now 2mbps = 4 * 256 kbps => 4 * 32kBps =  128kBps! (Boys thats fast)&hellip;That means you will use your 1024 megs quota in just  2 &frac12; hours&hellip;(excluding the free night usage)&hellip;</p>

<p>With an 900 UL plan there aint any limitations and this is what scares me..2 Mbps with an unlimited connection for 900 bucks is a godsend, really economical&hellip;But I have a sneaky feeling that the current 900 UL plan would be left out, forcing the heavy users to switch to other plans&hellip;GOtta save money if that happens..</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Bsnl, sneaky chums have cleanly excluded UL plans outta this&hellip; here <a href="http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/BBSTariff010107.htm">http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/BBSTariff010107.htm</a></p>

<p>The troubling thought is that, all are capped&hellip;and they are low&hellip;another thing is to note the &ldquo;upto&rdquo; word in the table except the Home 3300 plan. I think I will play safe and go with the present 900 UL&hellip;.I download around 10 gigs per month btw&hellip;none of those plans seems attractive&hellip;</p>

<p>Another year,  another disappointment&hellip;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Next time your friend (real or virtual) brags that he has got 3342142 friends in Orkut or MySpace or some other shitty portal..he/she may have visited <a href="http://www.fakeyourspace.com/">this site</a> and payed for them. How sick is this!!

<p>If you feel depressed that you didnt get a scrap for the last 10 minutes..GO get a life..and meet a good psychiatrist (hope i spelled that right..:))</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use glade to design UI for my project. So one day when I came to know that Glade3 has been released (rather late, actually) I decided to give it a shot. Glade 3 has its UI cranked so that you can efficiently create UI for your project..:|.. Anyway I dont know if it is just me but Glade 3 is slower than its predecessor and also crashed once in a while, especially when I was working with the design of the menu structure. On a happier note though, the crappy source code generation &ldquo;feature&rdquo; has been completely removed.. Yup&hellip;Glade2 had this feature wherein you could generate all the callback code..(That gave me nightmares..)</p>

<p>So with Glade, it is recommended to use libglade (and out of my own experience) to load the glade file during program execution. This has some advantages from the code generation.. First you carry less source code and somehow I felt it made my program clean. Secondly you dont have to recompile the entire project when you make changes to the UI. This is because the code generation in glade creates a separate source file called interface.c where all the UI code gets in by default as though you have hand coded them. But with libglade that doesnt exist since glade xml gets loaded during runtime kinda like in PyGTk if you know it.</p>

<p>Oh..and if you get the warning like
<code>libglade-WARNING: couldn't find the signal handler "some_signal_handler"</code>
This is because libglade couldnt find the symbols properly. Just add the &ldquo;&mdash;export-dynamic&rdquo; flag while compiling and you are done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are times when you screw so bad that you will never ever do that again. Yesterday an innocent rm * -rf deleted my full workspace and all my gMedCon Project files went kaput. A Whole week of work down the drain. gMedCon CVS at sourceforge is dead now thanks to me after my decision to cleanup the repository. So no backup code there either. I  have to start evrything from scratch. Thankfully glade3 doesnt have code generation, to mess stuff up.</p>
