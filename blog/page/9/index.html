		<p>w00t, pymoko runs in the qemu. The shared object extension got installed after building the openmoko toolchain from scratch. It did take me a whole day, but at the end it was frigging worth it. Thanks to stefan for pointing me to the solution. Now its party time.</p>

<p>Heres the screenshot where I import the pymoko module, show the available functions by doing a &lsquo;dir(pymoko)&rsquo;, and try to call my number (which obviously wont work) with voice_out_init().</p>

<p>The function call is unsuccessful because the gsm daemon doesnt appear to be running.</p>

		<p>So, Got myselves busy with <a href="http://www.openmoko.org">Openmoko</a>. Time will tell, if I would be able to get hold of the first device (neo1973) based on the platform. Anyway me and empty_mind had decided to bring our favourite programming, python to the platform. Of course <a href="http://www.openembedded.org">OpenEmbedded</a>, on which OpenMoko is based already provides python, but this time we are into customising the big snake for the Openmoko platform by writing language bindings, optimising runtimes. etc..No doubt fun times ahead.</p>

<p>I have even come up with an extension module that wraps up the Voice Out function of libgsmd. It works on my box but the damn thing isnt getting installed in the final image although it build just fine, so I couldnt really test it out if it works in the device (no..not the real device just the qemu stuff).</p>

<p>Have filed a bug report on this, hopefully it should be fixed.</p>

<p><em>Sigh</em>, heres the screenshot of the error in qemu.</p>

		<p>Take a look at this!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2007/05/18/indian_tech_vendors_protest_microsoft/">http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2007/05/18/indian_tech_vendors_protest_microsoft/</a></p>

<p>One of the many WTFs you get once in a while in the tech world. Apparently PC dealers are on a state wide bandh after getting notices from Microsoft for Piracy. And these guys are claiming that they are doing a &ldquo;service&rdquo; to the community by installing illegitimate copies of Windoze.</p>

<p>SITA or South Gujarat Information Technologists Association says, &ldquo;&#8221;Since we are are not charging anything extra for installing the software, it means that we are actually not trading in pirated software. For us this is just a sewa (selfless act) that we are offering to our customers. Besides, the pricing of their operating systems is way too high for the Indian markets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yup, while I agree about the pricing of M$ products..And keeping their &ldquo;Ethics&rdquo; (or the lack of it) aside, I somehow feel for M$. Whatever said, Software Piracy is akin to stealing stuff and theres no way you can defend yourself by telling that you are a doing a god damn frigging &ldquo;sewa&rdquo;. Piracy is so rampant that people think that Windoze comes free with their computers. And an association that exists, supporting these Pirates, sheesh!. If you cant afford a software, buy or use something thats Free or costs less. And even if you are using a illegitimate copy of something, just dont fucking go around telling people that you are part of a great liberation revolution or worse, claim that you are doing service to the community by distributing them.</p>

<p>Wondering, if a day will come when pimps will roam around telling that they are doing a &ldquo;sewa&rdquo; to the public. Its high time the Government steps in and stop these guys. (I do my bit when someone asks me to install winxp, I ask them to STFU.)</p>

<p>And my evil mind says that I should try it as a prank on local computer dealers.</p>

<p>And if you are someone I know and have a problem in your wretched boxes, FUCK OFF! I WONT FIX IT unless its running GNU/Linux or something legally bought.</p>

<p>Man, am I feeling a sudden urge to skin these people alive.</p>

		<p>Python is a rocking programming language. I was looking forward to try it on my old ngage qd..Sadly it didnt come with any MMC cards. My friend was kind enough to let me have his 64 meg card for a few days. I couldnt be happier :)</p>

<p>I had a few hiccups getting python on my phone. First the sourceforge page for s60 housed py60 ver 1.3.x, which refused to install in my phone. I finally found out the link to the version compatible (1.2) with the Symbian OS in my phone, but I had to register in that site, boy was the website crawling. In the end if you are looking to get python in you Ngage or Ngage QD, you will have to download &ldquo;Python for Series 60 1.2 for S60 <strong>1st </strong>Edition FP1 Devices&rdquo;[1]. Just Unzip the contents, keep the sis file in your mmc and install it like any other s60 application. The python is a pretty old version though, 2.2.2 to be exact.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots</p>

<p><strong>1.) The Python Interactive Console </strong></p>

		<p>Phew..Semesters on May 19 and lotsa stress beating upon me. I decided to cool off by paying a visit to my uncle&rsquo;s house</p>

<p>My cousin had a copy of Digital Fortress..Read it..The hell, Dan Brown has written X11 as &lsquo;X-Eleven&rsquo;&hellip;Nice book though.</p>

<p>Had to wake up really early and attend the annual day function of Dad&rsquo;s office. S Janaki, the playback singer was the chief guest along with Laxmanan, of MMA.</p>

<p>The fun part was in the evening when we paid a visit to the Marina. While having a hell of a time in the waves, My shorts tore where it shouldnt!. And Behold, there I was standing in the water wet, hot and sexy like a swimsuit model. It felt good when everyone was staring at me.</p>

<p>Thank god I was wearing my undies&hellip;</p>

		<p>Got my Semester practicals on Visual Programming tomorrow and I know bollocks about it. There was an urgent need to work out the lab exercises and get comfy and cozy with the VC++ IDE (Not one of the favourite students around :)) I did have wine around in my box, but never quite used it. If you are wondering what WINE is; Wine is a Free and Open Source Software that allows you to run most Winblows applications on your Linux box, effectively a port of Win32 platform, not an emulator afaik. So in a sense free Windows (I didnt mean Pirated..).</p>

<p>Got an Old CD of VC++ from my friend, popped it in and installed it without a hitch. I did get errors about some DCOM98 crap, but who the hell cares. I am gonna keep it installed for only one day and will be busting it first time after I finish my practicals tomorrow.</p>

		<p>Day 2 of barcamp was more fun, Met some more people..The day ended with a feedback session which was quite enlightening, The day ended with everyone signing their sigs on the large banner. Boy, did I have to catch lalbagh the next morning to catch the train to home.</p>

<p>My only gripe about the event was that, it turned out to be a platform for giving demonstrations rather than a brainstorming event, where everyone gets to use their neurons to solve ideas and discuss them. Also I could see a trend of start ups investing heavily on web 2.0 with many sessions about social networking.</p>

		<p>So, here I am writing from kushal&rsquo;s place with my friend&rsquo;s lappy with wireless internet.</p>

<p>Barcamps<a href="[Barcamp.org](http://www.barcamp.org/)">1</a> are a way for people to unwind with technical stuff, with massive amounts of knowledge being shared among the participants. Barcamp 3 this year was my first conference..er unconference outside Chennai. Mom and Dad were reluctant at first especially about accommodations and stuff, but agreed once kushal let me stay with him for the event.</p>

<p>Booked train tickets for friday afternoon which was boring as hell..The fact that I had a dry book to keep me company only made it worse. Reached Bangy at about 1940, apparently 4 o minutes late, had an auto for 20 bucks to kushal&rsquo;s place..and almost immediately we started playing around with our lappies..Check out the photos at flickr. Had a nice sleep in an adjacent room as well..</p>

<p><strong>DAY 1:</strong></p>

<p>IIM Bangalore, the venue for the event was some 25-30 minutes from home by bike. Boy, the campus was one sexy piece of work..rustic, modern with exposed stone walls that gave an old minimalistic perspective to the campus. The speakers pinned their talks in the notice board themselves; The participants get to decide about the schedule by themselves. Did struggle to get Wifi working on my lappy..But in the end I was missing restricted modules, A nice dude downloaded the packages for me and after half an hour or so I was connected. Tuxmaniac turned out for the event as well. The rest of the day was spent on attending sessions, meeting some people and basically networking. The session about Socialnets and Widgets were quite good at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Day2 coming up</p>

<p>Dont forget to check out the pics <a href="[Photos">2</a></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>College Exibhition day is always fun. You get to make a lot of scene with whatever little knowledge you have on the subject. For this year me and my buds chose to setup a small OpenMosix Cluster rendering farm to give a demonstration of High Peformance Computing with Linux. CluterKnoppix and Blender did our work job quite painlessly but&hellip;In a way Exibhitions and Symposiums are different. Your work can bomb if the visitors dont get the concepts of your project in Exibhitions.  In Symposiums most of the guys attending know something if not all which is not so in Exibhitions.</p>

<p>Boy, did we have to search for the perfect configurations, Most of the systems were archaeic ones which didnt even have a PXE bootable LAN card. First Hurdle. Of the 4 CSE labs, 1 lab had everything except the CPUs, the other apparently housed expensive Pentium D ones, which were kept as show pieces and hence were Off-Limits. We were literally on our knees to convince the blokes to give us boxes. This left us with 2 labs, and tell you what both of them sucked. We could manage to rig up about 6 boxes which could boot through LAN, to set up our farm of which 2 were smuggled without anyone noticing. And yes our cluster did eventually work without a hitch, but we had wasted about 2 weeks to get the machines in the first place. Added to that someone nicked a webcam and a headphone from the lab in which we were working, that meant we had to do paperwork that made Visa applications look like a piece of cake.</p>

<p>In the end it was a disappointing two days, since we lost the expo which I think was not fair. But most of the staff were happy about out performance, That still remains our consolation.
I learnt a few things from this experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>Never become too technical. We just couldnt get the concepts to be implanted into the many mush brains out there.</li>
<li>For some reason the morons thought that Linux was inferior. We had to borrow a Debian Laptop with Beryl from my friend to show off GNU/Linux first and then our cluster..</li>
<li>Keep always two exibhits, One technical like the OpenMosix Cluster appealing to the technically inclined and the other for the mugbrains to drool upon. In our case Beryl + a Edited Video Song with additional special effects. (In case you were wondering it was the opening sequence from the Tamil film Ghajini). I felt people could relate well if you present them contrasting areas. In our case, Desktop and High Performance Computing.</li>
<li>Adapt to your audience. Give real world examples. For example we sited the Human Genome Project for the Bio-Tech students and staff, and the many Mathematical simulations for the Mathematics guys.</li>
<li>Be as visual as well, the GUI is better than the CLI when exibhiting. Its not the place to show off your shell skills. Show performance graphs, comparison charts et all. You get the picture</li>
<li>NEVER EVER brag&hellip;..We did that and we turned out to be a complete embarassment in the last.</li>
</ul>


<p>And to all the MORONS who mocked us. OPENMOSIX clusters arent just LANs to share your valuable data (a.k.a pr0n?), Its a way to achieve High Performance with limited resources..And YOU dont need a fucking monitor for your computer to work. Computers CAN boot without monitors.
And to the co-ordinators of exibhitions, judges with a &lsquo;nada&rsquo; knowlegde about the subject are totally not funny. They are frigging annoying&hellip;</p>

		<p>Forget the emacs vs vi (or vim) battles.</p>

<p>Vim has tabs in its latest 7.0 release. Quite simple actually. A new tab is as easy as doing a</p>

<p><code>:tabnew "filename"</code></p>

<p>Moving between tabs is easy too..</p>

<p><code>:tabp</code>
<code>:tabn</code></p>

<p>for moving to the previous and the next tab respectively</p>

<p>For closing the tab</p>

<p><code>:tabclose "wahtever"</code></p>

<p>Heres a neat thing I learnt from the Inter-Web. You can map the &ldquo;tabn&rdquo; and &ldquo;tabp&rdquo; to keyboard shortcuts. For this open you .vimrc (..or create one if it doesnt exist), and add this,</p>

<p><code>nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;C-n&gt; :tabnext&lt;CR&gt;</code>
<code>noremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;C-p&gt; :tabprevious&lt;CR&gt;</code></p>

<p>Long live, the cult of vi&hellip;</p>
