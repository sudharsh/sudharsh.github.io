  <div class="entry-content"><p>Four words. <a href="http://www.shaastra.org/2008/">Shaastra</a> &lsquo;08 was frigging awesome. I was there a couple of days and had fun meeting people (shres, madhusudhan and many others). Also got to speak about FSO framework (slides later) as part of the FOSS sub-conference. Lots of food, some awesome talks and a wonderful atmosphere made the event memorable. Too bad, I had to leave early for the FOSS HackFest on 2nd night.</p>

<p>Only one gripe though, the event was not laptop friendly =(, It would have been awesome if the organizers had provided wifi spots near the talk venues.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://kstars.wordpress.com/">kstars</a>, <a href="http://arunchaganty.wordpress.com/">vimzard</a>, vikram and other volunteers for organizing the event .</p>

<p>In Chennai we have three seasons, summer (nov-march), f***ing hot summer (april &ndash; june), a mildly wet but still hot summer (july-oct). In case you are wondering where I am pointlessly heading to, I was talking about the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code 2008</a> which ended successfully for me :D; the code which I submitted was only about 56KB which means I was the laziest among the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/openmoko/about.html">9 other GSoC&#8217;ers</a> for <a href="http://www.openmoko.com">Openmoko</a>. On the whole, I think Openmoko had a wonderful SoC this year.</p>

<p>I will continue working on the freesmartphone.org initiative and do my little bit to help around. I was planning to release the ipks along with FSO milestone 3, but it turned out that my build tree wouldn&rsquo;t let me to do that without a fight (at `NOTE: Running task 256 of 718&#8217; now), will post the link once I have the packages. Get it <a href="http://sudharsh.mukt.in/odeviced_0.1-r0_armv4t.opk">here</a>. (Thanks to mukt.in team for hosting it)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">Software Freedom Day</a> will be celebrated worldwide on September 20 (third saturday of September) and the <a href="http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc">ILUG-C</a> gang will be there at Kamban Engineering College, Thiruvannamalai this year. So if you are in Chennai at that time and want to do something fun for the weekend, please volunteer!.</p>

<p>P.S: I am planning to give away my Freerunner for free, first to comment this post gets it..</p>

<p>..NOT!</p>

<p>Phew. GSoC 2008 program is going to end in a couple of days and boy, did I have fun. Most of the code for the second phase was actually pushed last week. Anyway, here are the updates.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Accelerometer plugin for Freerunner. Now you can use odeviced to retrieve accelerometer values for the position of the device along the x,y,z axes.</p></li>
<li><p>Completed Powercontrol plugin. Kept putting this off, but got myself to complete it today.</p></li>
<li><p>IdleNotifiers enabling apps to keep track of the state of the device viz. IDLE, BUSY&hellip;etc</p></li>
<li><p>Input plugin for signalling input events on DBus. Like button presses, etc. Should make this asynchrounous once vala offers support for async DBus on the server side (&lsquo;read&rsquo; systemcall can block)</p></li>
<li><p>Initial Audio plugin, am keeping this as a TODO outside GSoC.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The daemon is far from complete and GSoC was meant to be just the beginning to get the basics right. Integration of odeviced as a subsytem of a frameworkd implementation (theres already a python implementation) in C is something I am looking forward to contribute in the next few months. It would be uber cool, if someone lends a helping hand for now to make odeviced work on other devices on which openmoko (and FSO) can run.</p>

<p>I am not sure if people will find this interesting, but still</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The plugins average around 14kB in size, with powercontrol being the biggest of all. (25KB)</p></li>
<li><p>The main odeviced binary is around 26KB, which IMO, is quite teency weency.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>(But given the fact that the code links against GLib and DBus, I have no idea if these numbers mean anything at all. I would be grateful if anyone thinks this is something to cheer about)</p>

<p>P.S: I am looking for a temporary place to host the ipks for the lazy ones, will post the link once I get that. Meanwhile, get the code <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=summary">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/image000.jpg?w=512"></p>

<p>After intense negotiations with the college that made me realise that I could be a good business man, I was given OD to attend <a href="http://mukt.in">mukt.in</a>. I was there to talk on DBus (which by the way was EPIC FAIL!). On a brighter side, I had fun showing off my gsoc code to people at <a href="http://www.qvantel.com/open.html">qvantel</a>. One of the things that I learned from this &ldquo;version&rdquo; of mukt.in was to prepare talks well in advance, otherwise you end up giving a mediocre presentation.</p>

<p>There were a lot of great things about mukt.in this year than the last version. The venue, the speaker list, the topics covered and the people who attended it.</p>

<p>The entire scope of mukt is to introduce people to FOSS. This is quite unlike other &ldquo;biggies&rdquo; in India like foss.in which is mainly concerned with the developer folk. In fact, mukt.in was more like fossconf with regards to its intended audience. Last year was more satisfying for me personally because I got a chance to actively help around. This year I didn&rsquo;t move my butt and was pampered like a elite speaker, which I felt to be weird.</p>

<p>But at the same time, the event as a whole was a great success! The interactions between the speakers was awesome, many of us whom were using the free wifi at krish&rsquo;s place. His mom made me feel home and all salutes to a nice lady who happens to make the best &ldquo;chai&rdquo; ever.</p>

<p>We also visited Charminar, Got stuck at Hussein Sagar in the midnight where there were no local buses, realised that samosas can cost a fortune in some places (;) ). And of course, thanks to <a href="http://www.ajuonline.net/blog2">Aju</a> bhaiyya for the tee. (you are the best for now :D)</p>

<p>Ok, so here are some of my thoughts on improving mukt.in with which I have become quite attached,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I feel the duration of the event to be too long. Two days would be apt and the third day, as <a href="http://shakthimaan.com/">mbuf</a> put forth rightly, could be made as a &ldquo;Picnic day&rdquo;. Get a mini-van for the speakers and visit the tourist spots or some hang-out. A wonderful way to get together and make mukt more of a friendly cozy foss event that everyone would love to attend.</p></li>
<li><p>Be a bit strict with the kind of talks that make it to the final lists. Ask the speakers to submit slides and be strict with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Chinese food, all the three days was a bit sucky. Tokens from the local canteen would have been cool instead.</p></li>
<li><p>I realised this rather late, but the mukt.in logo could have been a bit more expressive. Like a little image of Charminar or even the Buddha of Hussein Sagar that adds some weight to the logo. You get the picture.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I guess thats about it. Next time, I am ruddy damn sure mukt.in will be bigger and more &ldquo;mukt&#8221;ier.</p>

<p>@mukt.in organizers, take a week off and sleep well. You guys deserve it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a week&rsquo;s waiting my mentor informed me that I had passed the mid-term evaluations. (he said that my performance for the first phase exceeded his expectations. :D ).</p>

<p>Its been a long time since I actually blogged about the progress. After I got the Freerunner in my hand (muhuhahahaa), it was more fun since there were subtle changes in the way the code ran on the device. Tracking down segfaults was uber awesome.</p>

<p>Plugins are now written <em>entirely</em> in vala. Earlier, this used to be an ugly abomination of hand-written and vala generated C code. Now, where good ol&#8217; C is necessary, .vapis&#8217; have been added that wrap around code written in C.</p>

<p>Additionally plugins for rtc, input and led were added. Input plugin is incomplete though. The code isn&rsquo;t perfect yet, so need to refine them and make them a bit tight in some places. rtc and led especially needs some tweaks.</p>

<p>I guess most of the second phase will be spent on syncing with frameworkd. Now, the python device daemons have been integrated into a single daemon with odeviced as one of the subsytems. (Earlier this was separate). The python daemon is uber-cool by itself, but imagine a C implementation of the entire frameworkd. Light on resources and excellent in performance, if done <strong>right</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sunday&rsquo;s are fun. Even more, when you get together with your school buddies for a long chaat.. Burp!</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen most of these guys for a looong time. So it was fun reliving the school moments. As for me, I was mostly silent having my mouth full with &ldquo;Dahi Puris&rdquo;. Seriously, Adayar Ananda Bhavan in Tambaram makes a good bunch of them. Its an ecstatic experience, when the &ldquo;puri&rdquo; breaks in your mouth releasing dollops of fresh sweet yoghurt with an assortment of tingly sauces. Try it when you go there. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>It would have been awesome if the entire class turned up. (That way I could have eaten more ;) )</p>

<p>And special full credits to vidhya for bringing a camera that didn&rsquo;t have batteries. Now, we have to be satisfied with crappy pics taken from even crappier mobile phones.</p>

<p>Also, my mentor is happy with my GSoC performance, so looks like I will pass my mid-term evaluations. Yay! What a weekend&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days gone by, and endless wrestling with git wherein I was not able to push code. Turned out, I was using the wrong URL to push ..doh!</p>

<p>But anyway, the <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=summary">code</a> is beginning to stabilise a bit (Read no unexpected segfaults, only expected ones..). The last few days were spent in changing the method names in accordance with OTAPI naming conventions after my mentor went through my code.</p>

<p>There is also another important change. The sysfs nodes for backlight and power plugins were hardcoded in their configuration files. So, I came up with some helpers that creates DBus paths automatically based on the device class which they belong to. Here&rsquo;s a picture of today&rsquo;s code in action,</p>

<p><a href="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/screenshot1.png"><img class="center" src="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/screenshot1.png?w=512"></a></p>

<p>Notice the <a href="https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/d-feet/">d-feet DBus</a> debugger towards the lower left? It shows all the automatically created DBus object paths based on the device class which the plugin stands for. And the terminal to the right shows some debug messages. Note how odeviced spits out the current battery status viz. &ldquo;Charging, Discharging&rdquo;. The corresponding &ldquo;battery-status-changed&rdquo; DBus signal is emitted as well (along with &ldquo;low-battery-warning&rdquo; signal which <em>ahem</em> is emitted when battery is low).</p>

<p>For more follow this <a href="http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-devel/2008-June/003002.html">thread</a>..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am pretty sure my friends would go &ldquo;WTF, you are too dumb for Goog&rdquo; by now.</p>

<p>Guess what, I am a <a href="http://www.ajuonline.net/blog2/technology/2008/06/10/rtfm-nah-go-look-at-my-employers-website/">full time employee</a> of Google now!. (<em>ahem</em> for three months).</p>

<p>I was more of an impression that I was technically an intern for three months. But after reading <a href="http://www.ajuonline.net/blog2/technology/2008/06/10/rtfm-nah-go-look-at-my-employers-website/">Aju&rsquo;s post</a>, it turns out all Summer of Code students are technically full time employees. (Anyone thinking otherwise please comment).</p>

<p>This means I get uber bragging rights.</p>

<p>What happens after 3 months when I am jobless again?</p>

<p>Simple. Just tell everyone <em>&ldquo;I quit&rdquo; </em>because they refused to send me another t-shirt. :D</p>

<p>Speaking of GSoC, the progress report of my project can be found <a href="http://projects.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-standards/2008-June/000096.html">here</a>. For some strange reason I was not able to push code to the <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=summary">git repository</a>. Find today&rsquo;s snapshot <a href="http://sudharsh.unixpod.com/odeviced-20080610.tar.bz2">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/image004.jpg?w=128"></p>

<p>As the summer holidays progress, I am finding myself become a nocturnal being. My sense of a &ldquo;day&rdquo; has changed a lot.</p>

<p>Wake up at 1200 or 1300 hours and fall asleep at around 2-3 AM, in a position as in the above photo (taken from my mobile which has a crappy camera). Back against the window, legs across my cot only to find myself waking up late in the afternoon sun with an excruciating pain in my back. Its great in a way, since both my parents leave for work early and I have the entire house to myself (na, I don&rsquo;t run around naked).</p>

<p>After waking up, the usual stuff, watch TV for a while and back to GSoC stuff..</p>

<p>Move my butt around at 5 PM to the guitar classes, return back watch Seinfeld, eat, and back to code&hellip;</p>

<p>Trust me, fixing segfaults are really fun, but I think I need to go out and play for a while&hellip; :/..I find myself lacking a <strong>life</strong> these days :(</p>
