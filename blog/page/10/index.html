		<p>So, one of my friends turned up today with his new moto v3i asking for help..Pretty simple, put music in his mobile and make it accessible through itunes software bundled with v3i.</p>

<p>With a sense of confidence I connected it to my box, and voila it was detected as a Mass Storage Device. He gave me the CDs that came with his mobile. I gave him a smirk in return and said &ldquo;This is Linux..Linux doesnt need any steenking windows driver cd&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I copied some songs over his mobile in the itunes folder. But no songs in itunes. After scratching my head for a while, I decided to give gtkpod a shot..So fired uo my trusty shell and did a &ldquo;emerge gtkpod&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In gtkpod in &ldquo;Edit iPod Properties&rdquo;, i selected the device as xmobile, connected the mobile and this time syncing the music worked&hellip;</p>

<p>He is now probably wondering whether to give gentoo a go..</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>BSNL has claimed that they will upgrade all the 256k connections to 2mbps..Juicy&hellip;</p>

<p>One thing puzzling me though is the fact that I have a 900UL connection. Anyone with some other plan with a 2 Mbps connection has to be mental&hellip;..For example, 500 bucks per month entitles you for a free 1024 mb usage&hellip;2 Mbps with 1024megs is nothing. If you are applying for a BSNL connection, stay clear out of this plan. Its puny&hellip;For example,</p>

<p>256 kbps =  32 kBps (B &ndash;> Bytes, b &ndash;> bits, this is what everyone advertise)&hellip;</p>

<p>So..Lets suppose you download a big file for an hour..In an hour there are 60 minutes and hence 60 * 60 = 3600 sec&hellip;So if you were to download something for an hour you would have downloaded 3600*32 =  115200 kBs or 115.2 MBs&hellip;.This is for 1 hour with a 256 kbps..So around some 9 hours you are done&hellip;.Yeah but of course you still have those night unlimited slots&hellip;.</p>

<p>Now 2mbps = 4 * 256 kbps => 4 * 32kBps =  128kBps! (Boys thats fast)&hellip;That means you will use your 1024 megs quota in just  2 &frac12; hours&hellip;(excluding the free night usage)&hellip;</p>

<p>With an 900 UL plan there aint any limitations and this is what scares me..2 Mbps with an unlimited connection for 900 bucks is a godsend, really economical&hellip;But I have a sneaky feeling that the current 900 UL plan would be left out, forcing the heavy users to switch to other plans&hellip;GOtta save money if that happens..</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Bsnl, sneaky chums have cleanly excluded UL plans outta this&hellip; here <a href="http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/BBSTariff010107.htm">http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/BBSTariff010107.htm</a></p>

<p>The troubling thought is that, all are capped&hellip;and they are low&hellip;another thing is to note the &ldquo;upto&rdquo; word in the table except the Home 3300 plan. I think I will play safe and go with the present 900 UL&hellip;.I download around 10 gigs per month btw&hellip;none of those plans seems attractive&hellip;</p>

<p>Another year,  another disappointment&hellip;.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I use glade to design UI for my project. So one day when I came to know that Glade3 has been released (rather late, actually) I decided to give it a shot. Glade 3 has its UI cranked so that you can efficiently create UI for your project..:|.. Anyway I dont know if it is just me but Glade 3 is slower than its predecessor and also crashed once in a while, especially when I was working with the design of the menu structure. On a happier note though, the crappy source code generation &ldquo;feature&rdquo; has been completely removed.. Yup&hellip;Glade2 had this feature wherein you could generate all the callback code..(That gave me nightmares..)</p>

<p>So with Glade, it is recommended to use libglade (and out of my own experience) to load the glade file during program execution. This has some advantages from the code generation.. First you carry less source code and somehow I felt it made my program clean. Secondly you dont have to recompile the entire project when you make changes to the UI. This is because the code generation in glade creates a separate source file called interface.c where all the UI code gets in by default as though you have hand coded them. But with libglade that doesnt exist since glade xml gets loaded during runtime kinda like in PyGTk if you know it.</p>

<p>Oh..and if you get the warning like
<code>libglade-WARNING: couldn't find the signal handler "some_signal_handler"</code>
This is because libglade couldnt find the symbols properly. Just add the &ldquo;&mdash;export-dynamic&rdquo; flag while compiling and you are done.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>ETK is a gui toolkit similar to gtk and is a part of Enlightenment Foundation Libraries or EFL. The syntax is very similar to GTK with only minor differences. Infact you could even use Glade to design GUI with ETK. For this you need a small but nifty tools called &lsquo;enhance&rsquo; also part of E. Glade btw is a tool which removes the need of manipulating each and every widget manually. It does all these in an efficient manner  leaving the developer to concentrate only on callbacks.</p>

<p>I am very new to ETK+Enhance and dont know which is better. EWL or ETK. If someone could shed light on this,  I would be grateful. Myself, being a novice found the lack of documentation for enhance a bit unnerving. But still I managed to get hold of the concepts. So here is a short tutorial about using &lsquo;enhance&rsquo; to parse your .glade files and use them in your etk source codes.  Comments are welcome.</p>

<p>I assume some knowledge in ETK or atleast GTK&hellip;Lets dig in..</p>

<p>Now create a glade file with the name of project1.glade. Create a simple window with a single button in it. Now in the property window of the button in the Signal tab, add the following information Signal->Clicked, Handler->
, in our case &ldquo;button_callback&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following code is the famous hello world program using ETK and glade for creating the GUI..</p>

<p>`#include &ldquo;Etk.h&rdquo;</p>

<h1>include &ldquo;Enhance.h&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Enhance <em>en;
void button_callback(Etk_Object </em>obj, void <em>data)
{
printf(&ldquo;Whee THis works\n&rdquo;);
}
int main(int argc, char </em>argv[])
{
enhance_init();
etk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
en=enhance_new();
enhance_file_load(en, &ldquo;window1&rdquo;, &ldquo;project1.glade&rdquo;);
etk_main();
enhance_free(en);
enhance_shutdown();
etk_shutdown();
return 0;
}`</p>

<p><code>`
Ok now a step by step description of whats up
</code></p>

<h1>include &ldquo;Etk.h&rdquo;</h1>

<h1>include &ldquo;Enhance.h&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Enhance *en;`
We are just including header files that is required for our program..duh! Anyway the third line, we are creating a pointer for the Enhance datatype. &lsquo;en&rsquo; will be used while loading  our .glade file</p>

<p><code>void button_callback(Etk_Object *obj, void *data)
{
printf("Whee THis works\n");
}</code>
The above function is the callback function. When we click the &ldquo;button&rdquo; of our program the line within the printf would output to the console. If you dont understand what I am tallking about visit the gtk website and download the tutorial to get an idea of what callbacks and widgets are.
<code>
enhance_init();
etk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);</code>
We are initialising enhance and etk..
<code>
en=enhance_new();</code>
Remember the pointer &lsquo;en&rsquo; of datatype Enhance. en now becomes a new instance of enhance..</p>

<p><code>enhance_file_load(en, "window1", "project1.glade");</code>
The above line will load the widget &ldquo;window1&rdquo; from the &ldquo;project1.glade&rdquo; file and &ldquo;en&rdquo; will point th them. You should load each widget, for example, you may have more than one window in your .glade file.
The remaining lines are self-explainatory..:D</p>

<p>Save the file as hello.c, in the directory containing project1.glade..and compile the program
<code>gcc -g hello.c  -o hello</code>enhance-config &mdash;libs &mdash;cflags<code></code>pkg-config &mdash;libs &mdash;cflags&#8220;</p>

<p>If all went well, you will be left with the executable called &ldquo;hello&rdquo;..
run it
<code>./hello</code>
You will get a small window with the button with E17 theming  containing the label you had specified while creating the gui with glade. Click on the button and you will see the text &ldquo;Whee THis works&rdquo; output on the console everytime it is clicked.

If you find something wrong, which is mostly likely, please comment about them. I am learning ETK/enhance myself.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Grr..First GNOME, now KDE getting on to my nerves..No matter what I try i just cant get enough juice out of them..Yesterday I decided I will try E17 but couldnt quite do it because of the time needed to compile all the dependencies one by one..Luckily theres a live cd distro called elive 0.5.2 which attracted my attention. The screenshots were stunning and I could see why the developers were calling it a work of art.</p>

<p>Installer was quite buggy in the sense that you get only Ok and Cancel buttons, the latter one doing the job of the &lsquo;No&rsquo; button. Also from time to time the time interval between two successive dialogs were quite freaky especially during the partition part. That said, the speed of installation is the fastest I have evr experienced..</p>

<p>After Installation the initial boot up time though small was extended by the post-install configuration and after that I was greeted by a very cool login manager called as entrance.</p>

<p>Elive offers two themes by default Elive and Lukas, a light and a dark theme respectively. By the way, eye candy was totally awesome with some sexy animations and effects. All this and my card doesnt even support direct rendering!! E17 is a really light desktop &lsquo;shell&rsquo; but amazingly beautiful&hellip;</p>

<p>All said the desktop does require some bit of playing around. I took around 2 hours to get used to it. But let me assure you, its worth it. Now my desktop is less cluttered and sports a clean look..And this is the first distro I have used which has flash, java and win32 codecs out of the box..
Go get elive at <a href="http://elivecd.org">Elivecd.org</a>

A detailed review <a href="http://flaviostechnotalk.com/wordpress/index.php/2005/09/04/elive-03-review/">here</a></p>

<p>Heres a screenshot of my desktop showing the snazzy elive panel. Note that everything moves in E17&hellip;too bad I cant show them. Check them out yourself :P</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Had a laughter riot after my system software semester practicals today..My external examiner asked me an all too simple question to gauge my intelligence..He asked me about addressing modes in the SIC architecture..I didnt remember it to be honest and then he proceeded to ask me about bits and bytes in general..I wrote in a piece of paper
1024 bytes &ndash;> 1 Kilobyte
1024 Kilobytes &ndash;> 1 Megabyte
1024 Megabytes &ndash;> 1 Gigabyte
He stood his ground that I was wrong and even threatened me that he will reduce my marks..I had to give in to his ridiculous theory at last and sat down in my place..
While all the other students were treated to his viva, I moved on; not giving up, and created a text file with exactly 1024 characters, saved it and showed its property dialog (whose size was shown as 1kb (1024bytes)) to my internal examiner and subsequently was called by the external examiner for another session of viva..Only this time, not willing to show his ignorance started exploiting mine!</p>

<p>I was made to sit in the lab till 3:30&hellip;
Wondering whether his students argued with their examiner that 1024bytes !=  1 Kilobyte</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Chennai is not particularly known for its pleasant weather..I know why.
Its either the heat or the water..yes, water especially during the monsoons.</p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong>
I like the heavy rains for two reasons. One, it ensures that the price of the water will still stay below that of crude oil for the rest of the year; Two, Holidays..Ahh..its blissful to wake up early in a monday morning, the sight of dark gloomy clouds bringing rain like anything, and the morning news bringing the news that its &ldquo;holiday today&rdquo;&hellip;Hmmm..Nothing like bunking classes for a valid reason..:D</p>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong>
The roads..Roads here are so bad that its too &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; even for rally cars. And the North East Monsoon just makes it worse..:s..I live in a low lying area and the road has now become a fishing pond with everyone blocking the way with their fishing poles and worse, it is the site of the amphibian love making in the night..I would say a field trip for the zoologists (I love animals myself, but croaking noises when you are dreaming about owning a cray3 is bit too far for me).</p>

<p><strong>The Worse</strong>
This is what really pisses me off..Everything around me is sticky and wet..My mom was mocking the whole day today that I need diapers when I sleep..Right now my bed is having a bright canary yellow bed cover that reminds me off eastman coloured movies, just because my usual favourite green one is damp&hellip;And believe me I didnt do it..Also the keyboard is sticky, and coding with a sticky keys and a mushy mouse has become a PITA</p>

<p>Hmmm..Just wondering what the blokes at my college hostel are doing&hellip;Their situation must be really FUBAR&rsquo;d since they live in an amphibian love making site throughout the year..:D</p>
