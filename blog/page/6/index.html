  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had been looking for a machine replacing my 4 and a half year old computer which served me really well. I was really keen on buying (my daddy actually) a Dell XPS m133o. But the lack of payment options and the service tax really added to the hefty price. Yesterday my mom took a stroll around the Sony World and found a 14 incher which she thought would fit my needs. I went and took a look and it was love at first site. Today I brought it home :D..</p>

<p>Its a Sony Vaio VGN CR 36, The specifications are really competitive..Here goes,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Core 2 Duo t8100 clocking atround 2.1 Ghz.</p></li>
<li><p>2 gigs of RAM</p></li>
<li><p>200 GB hard disk (comes with 5400 RPM drive, could have been a 7200)</p></li>
<li><p>ATi Radeon x2300</p></li>
<li><p>3 USB ports, one firewire, RJ 45 connector..blah blah blah</p></li>
<li><p>and the 14.1 inch WXGA display that looks drop dead gorgeus</p></li>
<li><p>The usual goodies, a web cam, finger print reader..etc</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All this at a 54k, and I feel its a good deal, especially with the 0% finance they offer..</p>

<p>First of all, the keyboard is lifted straight from the macbooks (Apparently its the other way round, macs copied the keyboard from older vaios) and has that buttony feel to it. Its sturdy and a pleasure to use. Top marks there&hellip;</p>

<p>Its neither light nor heavy and the build quality is excellent. However the battery that comes with the CR is quite flimsy. I am afraid its a borky design. There is noticeable shake and it falls right off if I forget to lock it. Big Bleh on that.</p>

<p>One really cool thing about the laptop is the fact that the fan is at the sides and not at the bottom thus saving your balls.</p>

<p>The screen is brilliant that offers minimal reflection even though the LCD is glossy.</p>

<p>It ships with Vista which in my not so humble opinion is next to dog barf. (The warranty doesn&rsquo;t get screwed up if I nuke it).</p>

<p>Getting ready to install Gentoo on it. Tried putting the gutsy cd but refused to start X. The radeon must be the culprit for this one. I will come up with my experiences of installing Gentoo on it in the next post</p>

<p>Overall its a sexy machine that oozes OMFGAWESOMENESS with a competitive price. I foresee Dell cutting the prices on XPS now..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Totally screwed out for the last 5 days. 3 days of intense FOSS at Fossconf and internal assessments at College after that. What a week. I had Ub3rcool fun at fossconf meeting new people and matching irc nicks with faces, presenting a tutorial on writing python extensions and pygsmd, and of course voluntary work eating food which was provided to us.</p>

<p>I am feeling lazy to give a report on the event, which my fat elder bro has <a href="http://technofreakatchennai.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/fossconf-chennai-2008/">taken time to do so</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rats and mice are not funny. I admit it, I am not a guy a pest eradication centre will die for.</p>

<p>So, there I was, home alone with a big bottle of orange juice peacefully fighting with some python spaghetti I call code.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drip&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drip&rdquo;</p>

<p>&hellip;..</p>

<p>Frigging tap started leaking suddenly, went to investigate and out of my anger, broke it. There I was, drenched above the equator. I did manage to fix the leaky tap, (by the way it was 3 in the morning). And there, a goddamn cute little rat came out of nowhere and scurried over my toes and finally ended up under the refrigetator. Of course, I was pretty freaked out and in the process knocked over a few kitchen stuff.</p>

<p>Well I should have said &ldquo;bleh&rdquo;, and gotten back to my work. But I was not to be pwned by a sneaky rat. Took the <a href="http://openmoko.com/products-neo-base-00-stdkit.html">stylus</a> that came with the OpenMoko Kit, opened the front door for my furry friend to get out of my property. I switched on the torchlight + led laser thingy that comes with the stylus and pointed it right at the rat. Of course it was irritated but stayed put, and for a second, I thought I saw something moving by the front door. DAMN!. Another critter&hellip;I gave up, closed all doors and went to sleep&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>Now I got two rats somewhere in my house, watching over&hellip;..Remember next time you have a weird feeling, that schizophrenic experience, It must be the RATS&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got to test some code in the neo and found that sms sending using pygsmd works quite well!!..Also I was looking for an opportunity to brush up my 2 hour stint with pyGTK which I had a long long time ago. What better reason than to create a dirty, scrawny, crufty, fugly GUI for sending SMS. Heres a screenshot of the GUI in action taken from the neo itself. It doesnt really follow any GUI guidelines (who would care at 2:30 AM)&hellip;When you click SendSMS, it calls pygsmd.sms.send() and sends your message..and when you click Quit button, the obvious thing happens.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/screenshot-1.png"></p>

<p>Oh there is also this another more better looking tool called <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/SMSTool">SMSTool</a> by alessandro, you might want to check that out as well if you want, it achieves its purpose in a weird sort of interesting way. It communicates with libgsmd-tool in shell mode through python subprocesses.</p>

<p>If anyone is willing to modify the GUI and make it look more humane, be my guest..It ofcourse depends on pygtk and its dependencies</p>

<p>P.S: SVN in projects.openmoko.org seems to be down. So I was not able to commit these example scripts.</p>

<p>Goofup: I did it again..The SMSTool is written by <a href="http://mput.de/blog/">kriss</a> and maintaned by alessandro</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I dunno if it adds functionality to your already functional firefox, but still its damn cute and quite interesting from the technical point of view. Add a new &ldquo;persona&rdquo; to your browser on the fly. No crashes bringing down the house although, I am not able to resize the browser. Only a matter of time before someone comes up with a LOLCAT persona..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got some sms and phonebook code in the svn, but not all. So once I had some bindings finished. I decided to write a sort of example script that uses our pygsmd module. libgsmd-tool have always been a friend of mine in knowing whats up with gsmd. Therefore to pay a tribute to my good &ldquo;friend&rdquo;, I came up with a python script that mimics &lsquo;libgsmd-tool -m shell&rsquo;. Of course since pygsmd itself is yet to be completed, the script is incomplete although functional. Its been a long time since I had written a real python script, so if its not pythonic, please comment..The script is already in the svn,  so if you are interested take a look and most importantly test it out and extend it..=D</p>

<p>Heres a more sane version(88) from the <a href="http://projects.openmoko.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/*checkout*/python-gsmd/examples/pygsmd_shell.py?content-type=text%2Fplain&amp;rev=88&amp;root=python-openmoko">svn</a></p>

<p>And the screenshot of pygsmd-shell in action. Notice the AT commands in Phonesim to the right. And the screenshot of the script running in the neo.</p>
