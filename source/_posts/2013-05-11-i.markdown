More than Death, losing my memory scares the shit out of me.
It makes me queasy to think that all the wonderful experiences I had, the secrets in my head, my tough times and failures can go poof; slowly or in an instant without warning.

Doesn't matter if its due to some fucked up illness like Alzheimer's or a freak accident from sheer bad luck. It is very possible that I won't be _me_ one day.

The only bright side is that at least parts of my identity will live on as memories in people close to me if that happens. Coming to think of it, things won't be that bad after all :). As they say,
