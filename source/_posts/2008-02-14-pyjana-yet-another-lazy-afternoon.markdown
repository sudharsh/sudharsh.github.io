I havent been a big fan of creating python extensions using gobjects but noticed that the libjana by [chris](http://chrislord.net/blog/) doesnt have one. So just my bit to help around.

Bindings for the above libjana library. Still really really really........really (500th) super prototype code.

Get the bindings [here](http://sudharsh.unixpod.com/pyjana-proto.tar.gz)

As always all sorts of help is appreciated
