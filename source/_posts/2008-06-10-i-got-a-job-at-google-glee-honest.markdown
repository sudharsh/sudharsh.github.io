I am pretty sure my friends would go "WTF, you are too dumb for Goog" by now.

Guess what, I am a [full time employee](http://www.ajuonline.net/blog2/technology/2008/06/10/rtfm-nah-go-look-at-my-employers-website/) of Google now!. (*ahem* for three months).

I was more of an impression that I was technically an intern for three months. But after reading [Aju's post](http://www.ajuonline.net/blog2/technology/2008/06/10/rtfm-nah-go-look-at-my-employers-website/), it turns out all Summer of Code students are technically full time employees. (Anyone thinking otherwise please comment).

This means I get uber bragging rights.

What happens after 3 months when I am jobless again?

Simple. Just tell everyone _"I quit" _because they refused to send me another t-shirt. :D

Speaking of GSoC, the progress report of my project can be found [here](http://projects.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-standards/2008-June/000096.html). For some strange reason I was not able to push code to the [git repository](http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=openmoko-gsoc2008.git;a=summary). Find today's snapshot [here](http://sudharsh.unixpod.com/odeviced-20080610.tar.bz2).
