Last week, [24camp](http://24camp.org/) started out as a means for people to get together and work on interesting projects/ideas.

Serendio will be hosting one this weekend, 13th February. We have place for about 20 - 25 in our office premises. More information can be found [here](http://24camp.org/Camp/13Feb2010).

You can also participate virtually by logging on to #24camp IRC channel on the Freenode servers. If you want to start a local, group of your own add your group in the wiki page mentioned above.
