Four words. [Shaastra](http://www.shaastra.org/2008/) '08 was frigging awesome. I was there a couple of days and had fun meeting people (shres, madhusudhan and many others). Also got to speak about FSO framework (slides later) as part of the FOSS sub-conference. Lots of food, some awesome talks and a wonderful atmosphere made the event memorable. Too bad, I had to leave early for the FOSS HackFest on 2nd night.

Only one gripe though, the event was not laptop friendly =(, It would have been awesome if the organizers had provided wifi spots near the talk venues.

Thanks to [kstars](http://kstars.wordpress.com/), [vimzard](http://arunchaganty.wordpress.com/), vikram and other volunteers for organizing the event .
