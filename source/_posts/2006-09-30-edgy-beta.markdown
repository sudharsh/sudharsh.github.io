Felt like doing an 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' to upgrade to edgy,

Edgy, by the way is the yet to be released version of ubuntu..[Check her out](http://www.ubuntu.com)

Heres what I did,

First, replace all instances of dapper in source.list to edgy

Second, sudo apt-get update

and finally sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Just make sure , you have the *buntu-desktop installed, otherwise the upgrade will break..

Edgy packs with all the latest stuff, Firefox Bon Echo, GNOME 2.16, KDE 3.5.4 and pretty much the latest software, The bootsplash is nothing short of slick..
