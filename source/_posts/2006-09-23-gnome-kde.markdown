I migrated to kde today..Gnome was getting on my nerves. It was slowww on my box.. Strangely kde is kinda faster..Hmm

I remember using kde some 2 years back..Thats long..:D
kde 3.5.2 looks stunning..Gnome looks clean.. I would stop my rants here. I am not even thinking of proceeding further.

Anyway because of the ldtp development going on, could not remove it completely.

amarok rocks, thanks to my unlimited connection (yeah..baby) I listened to podcasts and streams all day..Who cares how much I am downloading anyway..

I finished automating the help menu today ..well kind of.. still got some ironing to do..:D
