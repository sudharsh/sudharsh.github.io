Made an unplanned roadtrip to Pondicherry on my FZ yesterday. Driving on the ECR with the sunset on your right is pure bliss. The weather was good with occasional chilly bursts of sea breeze. Cruised the entire stretch at a comfortable 80km/hr.

Although not as long as my earlier [Yelagiri](http://sudharsh.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/road-trip-to-yelagiri/) trip, it was fun nevertheless. The former French colony seems to be at its best charm when it rains :D.

It is amazing how your senses become tuned to the road after riding for an hour or two. Hopefully, I will be doing far more longer trips this winter.
