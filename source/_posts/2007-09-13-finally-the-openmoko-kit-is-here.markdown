After weeks of waiting and sleepless nights guessing where our Openmoko advanced kit (Big thanks to NRCFOSS and Dr. Sreenivasan for sponsoring us the device) was, the kit has finally reached MIT and I got to touch the freed phone. The phone is quite handy and not as heavy as I expected it to be. Pics of the kit soon, when I go there on Monday.

The project roadmap is here. [http://projects.openmoko.org/docman/view.php/14/5/python-openmoko-roadmap.pdf](http://projects.openmoko.org/docman/view.php/14/5/python-openmoko-roadmap.pdf)

We are aware of how OpenEmbedded already has support for python, but one of our major areas of interests is optimizing the core, stripping it down kinda like what Nokia did for their Symbian based smartphones...Hop in if you are interested..
