I dunno if it adds functionality to your already functional firefox, but still its damn cute and quite interesting from the technical point of view. Add a new "persona" to your browser on the fly. No crashes bringing down the house although, I am not able to resize the browser. Only a matter of time before someone comes up with a LOLCAT persona..

Heres a cute screenshot
