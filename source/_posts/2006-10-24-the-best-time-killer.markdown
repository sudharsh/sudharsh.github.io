Life can be a crawl sometimes..seconds become minutes...Imagine a lazy cloudy monday morning with only mega serials to keep company...

Oh well, now that I have broadband, tried listening to podcasts...But amarok has a great feature which makes it one of the best media players.. Its ability to integrate with [last.fm](last.fm)

Been listening to last.fm for a whole day now. Lotsa genres, lotsa artists....Worth a try :)

Hence Amarok + last.fm + broadband + GOOD speakers = ONE heck of a time killer
