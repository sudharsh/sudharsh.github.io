Mozilla vs. Debian... I guess a major clash of egos is taking place between two giants. This time it is serious; KDE  vs. GNOME, Ubuntu vs. Debian, and all other flames wars have been taking place for eons but without serious consequences. The latest Mozilla. vs Debian tussle comes at a very tense time. Firefox has been gaining its share of the pie slowly and steadily, and Debian and its derivatives especially Ubuntu is coming up like a dream..

These two are FOSS organisations (now wouldnt want to discuss the FOSS'ness about Mozilla) and the tussle between two would be a big relief for IE. Just my 2 cents I always think that major FOSS innovations start from GNU/Linux and gradually spreads to other platforms with Windows somewhere in the middle. Taking into account this clash between the two, I am sure the supporters of the respective organisation would boycott the opposition..And hence user base will change. This is bad..Firefox's image would be dented in my opinion..And this would inevitably open doors for IE7 to push forward. Moreover users of Debian and its derivatives are more attached to their OS and I dont think people would switch to another distro because of a name. Here people == end users.

As if the never ending Proprietary vs. Free Softwares were not enough, the tussle between the two organisations has been provoked, not by the _other_ side but by themselves. Clashes between two organisations that are Open Source, is unhealthy for the community. If ever FOSS goes down, it will not be because of the competition with the Proprietary World, but because of the misunderstandings that take place in the community.

No community can sustain itself if it is plagued with clashes like this

In short, Jus get along guys, Bill is grinning at us..:D
