Hi,

Went to Valliyamai Engineering College for a symposium called neoRampage. Aptly named

Participated in all the competitions of the second day

Dumb C:

Our team found out two of the 4 clues, but sadly not enough to go through the next round

Quake and NFS UG2:

Wow..been a year since I had gamed. Played quake pretty well. Managed to get frag 5 times,..NFS UG2..Winner in the 1st round.:) 4th in the second..:(

Quiz:

Qualified for the last around after a tiring 1st round. 1st place till the last round. 3rd in the last..@#!@$ :(

Anyways the day was not one of the greatest today. Last night I had changed my broadband login id from <user>@dataone to <user>@dataone.in...Couldnt connect..

Had to take help from BSNL Tech Support to figure that ouy. Self-Respect at the lowest..
