Howdie,

I am pleased to announce that gmedcon, a port of xmedcon to gtk2.0 and libglade has been hosted at sourceforge.net.

[Click here](http://gmedcon.sourceforge.net) to visit the project page

xmedcon is a tool that is used to manipulate dicom images, a standard used in medical imagery. If you would like to help please give me a ping
