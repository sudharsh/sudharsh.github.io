Oracle is going to release its own Linux distribution if the following article is to be believed..

[http://www.cbronline.com/article_news.asp?guid=AC31F249-770C-4541-AFCC-186A757F3811](http://www.cbronline.com/article_news.asp?guid=AC31F249-770C-4541-AFCC-186A757F3811)

RedHat and Novell will definitely find this interesting. Am kinda wondering, if Oracle were to release its own distribution, Linux will become more famous. I guess its the 'ORACLE' name....

Of course it would be an expensive-enterprise-kinda-distro, Would be really interesting to see what happens...An Oracle Database Server running on an Oracle developed OS does instill some curiosity,..

Hmm..Wondering whether they would go in for GNOME or KDE as the default DE..
