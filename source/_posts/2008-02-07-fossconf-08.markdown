Totally screwed out for the last 5 days. 3 days of intense FOSS at Fossconf and internal assessments at College after that. What a week. I had Ub3rcool fun at fossconf meeting new people and matching irc nicks with faces, presenting a tutorial on writing python extensions and pygsmd, and of course voluntary work eating food which was provided to us.

I am feeling lazy to give a report on the event, which my fat elder bro has [taken time to do so](http://technofreakatchennai.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/fossconf-chennai-2008/).

The best I can do is give you some links =).
