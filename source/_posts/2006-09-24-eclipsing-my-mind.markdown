I downloaded eclipse ide and the cdt plugin which is used for c/c++ development, Eclipse runs slowwww on my 256 megs RAM, I don't get it, why does it slow down to a crawl. 256 megs is good enough...Aah maybe its because of the java stuff associated with it. Anyway I have not been a big fan of Java,

Speaking of which i need to give a talk on Java's Datatypes and Variables at my college..Worse still tomorrow is Monday, Who loves monday..@#~#$!
