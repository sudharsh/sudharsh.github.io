I will be entering final year in a couple of months and this means...PLACEMENTS!!! yay! (..or the lack of it)

This means more "Mock Interviews Sessions" and "GDs" to "empower" engineering students to get placed in the only 3 software companies that exist in this physical Universe. Infosys, TCS and CTS (Apparently our college is too dumb for _hybrid _corporates like m$).

And this [blog post](http://pravunplugged.blogspot.com/2005/03/mock-interview.html) sort of sums up my thoughts. Highly hilarious, rolled on the floor injuring my _mutti._

Especially at this,



_"Any actual work experience?
Buying groceries for my neighbour who has this pretty daughter called Gayathri."_


Oh, yeah! I can empathize.
