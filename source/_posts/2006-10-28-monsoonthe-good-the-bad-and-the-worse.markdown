Chennai is not particularly known for its pleasant weather..I know why.
Its either the heat or the water..yes, water especially during the monsoons.

**The Good**
I like the heavy rains for two reasons. One, it ensures that the price of the water will still stay below that of crude oil for the rest of the year; Two, Holidays..Ahh..its blissful to wake up early in a monday morning, the sight of dark gloomy clouds bringing rain like anything, and the morning news bringing the news that its "holiday today"...Hmmm..Nothing like bunking classes for a valid reason..:D

**The Bad**
The roads..Roads here are so bad that its too "dangerous" even for rally cars. And the North East Monsoon just makes it worse..:s..I live in a low lying area and the road has now become a fishing pond with everyone blocking the way with their fishing poles and worse, it is the site of the amphibian love making in the night..I would say a field trip for the zoologists (I love animals myself, but croaking noises when you are dreaming about owning a cray3 is bit too far for me).

**The Worse**
This is what really pisses me off..Everything around me is sticky and wet..My mom was mocking the whole day today that I need diapers when I sleep..Right now my bed is having a bright canary yellow bed cover that reminds me off eastman coloured movies, just because my usual favourite green one is damp...And believe me I didnt do it..Also the keyboard is sticky, and coding with a sticky keys and a mushy mouse has become a PITA

Hmmm..Just wondering what the blokes at my college hostel are doing...Their situation must be really FUBAR'd since they live in an amphibian love making site throughout the year..:D
