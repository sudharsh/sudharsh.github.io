BSNL has claimed that they will upgrade all the 256k connections to 2mbps..Juicy...

One thing puzzling me though is the fact that I have a 900UL connection. Anyone with some other plan with a 2 Mbps connection has to be mental.....For example, 500 bucks per month entitles you for a free 1024 mb usage...2 Mbps with 1024megs is nothing. If you are applying for a BSNL connection, stay clear out of this plan. Its puny...For example,

256 kbps =  32 kBps (B -> Bytes, b -> bits, this is what everyone advertise)...

So..Lets suppose you download a big file for an hour..In an hour there are 60 minutes and hence 60 * 60 = 3600 sec...So if you were to download something for an hour you would have downloaded 3600*32 =  115200 kBs or 115.2 MBs....This is for 1 hour with a 256 kbps..So around some 9 hours you are done....Yeah but of course you still have those night unlimited slots....

Now 2mbps = 4 * 256 kbps => 4 * 32kBps =  128kBps! (Boys thats fast)...That means you will use your 1024 megs quota in just  2 1/2 hours...(excluding the free night usage)...

With an 900 UL plan there aint any limitations and this is what scares me..2 Mbps with an unlimited connection for 900 bucks is a godsend, really economical...But I have a sneaky feeling that the current 900 UL plan would be left out, forcing the heavy users to switch to other plans...GOtta save money if that happens..

**UPDATE:**

Bsnl, sneaky chums have cleanly excluded UL plans outta this... here [http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/BBSTariff010107.htm](http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/BBSTariff010107.htm)

The troubling thought is that, all are capped...and they are low...another thing is to note the "upto" word in the table except the Home 3300 plan. I think I will play safe and go with the present 900 UL....I download around 10 gigs per month btw...none of those plans seems attractive...

Another year,  another disappointment....
