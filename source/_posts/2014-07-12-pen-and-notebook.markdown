I am one of those people with a very volatile memory. Unless I jot down things even if it is as mundane as getting a haircut, I find myself with a nagging sense of incompleteness in my head. It is a very uncomfortable feeling to have.

I had been trying to use [Evernote](http://evernote.com/), [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/en/) and [`org-mode`](http://orgmode.org/) to help solve this. No god damn luck. Only `org-mode` worked for me in the beginning but I found myself slowly starting to worry about how to format my fricking lists instead. 

My brain had started to [bikeshed](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bikeshedding) with itself!

For me, these tools turned out to be hard to focus with. And lo! I fell back to using a Pen and a Notebook instead.

Writing down todo lists feels much more satisfying than typing them. The contents somehow 'sticks' to my head and I don't need reminders on my phone anymore (which I mostly used to ignore anyways).

Of course, there are a lot of productivity problems solved successfully by software but I have come to a conclusion that simple personal todo lists is NOT one of them. 

Pen and Paper beats the Computer in this case.
