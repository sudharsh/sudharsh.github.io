For the last few weeks, my productivity has dipped to an all time low. [Progit](http://programming.reddit.com/) is to be blamed. Suddenly I find myselves hitting refresh to see what's 'hot' leading to more time reading blogs and articles, and less time actually getting some work done. So, from this point on I am activating a self-imposed ban on progit.

Lets see how long I last urge :D.

**EDIT: Bleh.... Gave up, ban lasted 12 minutes**
