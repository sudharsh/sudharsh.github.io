Yup, thats right..Thats how long it took for me to travel from my grandmas house to mine. The roads nearby look like they have been hit by 10.5 earthquake..Stupid Corporation lays a road, and turns them upside down two weeks after.

I had the misfortune of navigating through one of the most horrible roads constructed in human history. I am just thankful I returned in one piece. My vehicle, (rather my mom's; a bajaj spirit) was not so lucky, On reaching home, the garland put on it for the Durga pooja was reduced to a single thread, and the centre stand crippled like it was infected with polio.

WRC, Listen up and listen tight. You guys should consider Chromepet for the next years' rally championship. (Oh wait..that might not be safe for the drivers..)

And as for the TN Government, you can take my middle finger of my left hand..:)
