There are times when you screw so bad that you will never ever do that again. Yesterday an innocent rm * -rf deleted my full workspace and all my gMedCon Project files went kaput. A Whole week of work down the drain. gMedCon CVS at sourceforge is dead now thanks to me after my decision to cleanup the repository. So no backup code there either. I  have to start evrything from scratch. Thankfully glade3 doesnt have code generation, to mess stuff up.
