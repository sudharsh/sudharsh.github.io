So, here I am writing from kushal's place with my friend's lappy with wireless internet.

Barcamps[1] are a way for people to unwind with technical stuff, with massive amounts of knowledge being shared among the participants. Barcamp 3 this year was my first conference..er unconference outside Chennai. Mom and Dad were reluctant at first especially about accommodations and stuff, but agreed once kushal let me stay with him for the event.

Booked train tickets for friday afternoon which was boring as hell..The fact that I had a dry book to keep me company only made it worse. Reached Bangy at about 1940, apparently 4 o minutes late, had an auto for 20 bucks to kushal's place..and almost immediately we started playing around with our lappies..Check out the photos at flickr. Had a nice sleep in an adjacent room as well..

**DAY 1:**

IIM Bangalore, the venue for the event was some 25-30 minutes from home by bike. Boy, the campus was one sexy piece of work..rustic, modern with exposed stone walls that gave an old minimalistic perspective to the campus. The speakers pinned their talks in the notice board themselves; The participants get to decide about the schedule by themselves. Did struggle to get Wifi working on my lappy..But in the end I was missing restricted modules, A nice dude downloaded the packages for me and after half an hour or so I was connected. Tuxmaniac turned out for the event as well. The rest of the day was spent on attending sessions, meeting some people and basically networking. The session about Socialnets and Widgets were quite good at the end of the day.

Day2 coming up

Dont forget to check out the pics [2]
