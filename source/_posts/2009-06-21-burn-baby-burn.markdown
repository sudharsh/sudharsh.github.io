When it comes to fitness, I am one of those nerdy couch potatoes with a rather rotund tummy. Burning away calories has become an important priority now and boy, do I miss those Lays and the local Iyengar Bakery Bun Butter Jam and Puffs. For the last week, I have been waking up early and jogging for 30-40 minutes (I also got a good pair of running shoes). Should increase the workout time as weeks progress.

Oh, I also got a new job :D....
