Went to SSNCE for Converita, symposium by the IT fellows. As usual registered for all the events to increase my probability of taking home some money. And yes we did, This time I partnered with my long time school buddy, Prem after a long time for Quiz named Conquizta. Prelims was ok and we had a feeling we would get through and yes, we did. From the finals, it was pretty clear the quizmaster had made good use of the trivia sections of Wikipedia..yay..

Thats were we sucked, we had a pretty unproductive quiz finals with everyone around us scoring points. My college friends even walked out and that was pretty demotivating =(. But we picked up pace in the last three rounds, one of which was the weirdest ever..In the end we won the third place taking home a post dated check of 2000/-..Well another month covered =D....

...Cheers to the Organizers
