Remember the Java seminar i was talking about....I turned out to be a total mess...Yeah rite..how would people listen to someone who sits on the last bench and makes the classroom a total chaos for the lecturers..

Besided Eclipse and OO, both of them based on java (I think) runs slooooowww on my box.. I dont get it..Why does portability matter when you cant support a somewhat older hardware ..Mine is just two years old btw..
