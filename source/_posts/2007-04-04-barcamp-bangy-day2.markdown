Day 2 of barcamp was more fun, Met some more people..The day ended with a feedback session which was quite enlightening, The day ended with everyone signing their sigs on the large banner. Boy, did I have to catch lalbagh the next morning to catch the train to home.

My only gripe about the event was that, it turned out to be a platform for giving demonstrations rather than a brainstorming event, where everyone gets to use their neurons to solve ideas and discuss them. Also I could see a trend of start ups investing heavily on web 2.0 with many sessions about social networking.
