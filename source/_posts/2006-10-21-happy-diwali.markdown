Everyone, Happy Diwali..

Finally Gentoo irritated me to an extent that I have fully switched to Edgy. No offence meant, but gentoo is a great distro if you have the time and patience to cut it. But sadly I don't have either. 6 months of relationship with gentoo was insightful..

Spent the whole night yesterday installing and configuring Edgy.

First installed from the dapper cds

Then dist-upgraded to edgy and after that installed kubuntu-desktop and removed GNOME..

Let me tell you, upstart is kick ass application. Boots to my desktop really really fast.
