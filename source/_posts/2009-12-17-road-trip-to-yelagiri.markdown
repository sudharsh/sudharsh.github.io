[](http://sudharsh.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/photo-0017.jpg)I have been a lurker in the forums of [xbhp](http://www.xbhp.com/talkies/), just gaping in awe as these guys do [road trips to far off places](http://www.xbhp.com/talkies/tourer/8611-how-sikkim-chapter.html) complete with triplogs. I knew I wanted to do something like this and was itching to take my FZ for a ride in the great outdoors. The farthest I had been was the trip to A R Rehman's concert at Swarnabhoomi a couple of months ago.


A road trip was imminent and rallied two of my friends for a trip to Yelagiri, A small hill station retreat near Jolarpet. Nothing fancy like the Ooty or Kodai. Just a group of hills with the tallest point close to 1100m. Middle of December with cool weather was just so irresistible.

Alas, my friends couldn't make it and I had to go solo, without any company. The tripmeter at the end of the day read 484.5. Also, logged part of the return trip with TangoGPS in my Freerunner. I have uploaded the [traces to OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/sudharsh/traces/585929).

I have written a [fairly detailed triplog](http://www.xbhp.com/talkies/tourer/10982-chennai-yelagiri-solo-ride-lots-lots-rain.html#post346437) at the xbhp forums. Do read it :D
