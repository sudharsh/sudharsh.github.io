    "_Legolas Greenleaf long under tree_
    _In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea!_
    _If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,_
    _Thy heart shall rest in the forest no more._"
My favorite character from Lord of the Rings. Not as good as the [original](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Image:Legolas1.jpg), but I drew these after a very long time.. :)

I also felt like creating a [deviant](http://sudharsh.deviantart.com/) profile for myself.
