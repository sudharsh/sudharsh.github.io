Been long since I blogged. Not feeling lazy or something, but been kinda busy.

First stop, we had a 5 day trip to Kerala with my college buddies. Was nice to go back to a place which I once called home. I still dont know why my friends didnt like the banana bajjis  and the big rice there. The tour was fun although I came home with a bad cold.

Next thing, symposium preparations for my department are in full swing. Its been named Infovista much to my chagrin. The site is online at [http://www.infovista.in](http://www.infovista.in). The site is drupal powered and hosting is sponsored my #l-i buddy, jace.

Oh, and NRCFOSS has sponsored us a neo. We have been billed, waiting for the baby to reach us..:D
