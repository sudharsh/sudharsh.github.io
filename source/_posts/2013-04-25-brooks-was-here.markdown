**Minor spoilers ahead**

Like many others I love [Shawshank Redemption](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/). The scene where Brooks is out of prison and is unable to catch up with the world is just plain sad. One of my favorite all time movie scenes that gives me the chills every time.

I keep hoping Brooks found his Freedom.
