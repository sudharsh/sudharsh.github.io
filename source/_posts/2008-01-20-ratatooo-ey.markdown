Rats and mice are not funny. I admit it, I am not a guy a pest eradication centre will die for.

So, there I was, home alone with a big bottle of orange juice peacefully fighting with some python spaghetti I call code.

"Drip"

"Drip"

.....

Frigging tap started leaking suddenly, went to investigate and out of my anger, broke it. There I was, drenched above the equator. I did manage to fix the leaky tap, (by the way it was 3 in the morning). And there, a goddamn cute little rat came out of nowhere and scurried over my toes and finally ended up under the refrigetator. Of course, I was pretty freaked out and in the process knocked over a few kitchen stuff.

Well I should have said "bleh", and gotten back to my work. But I was not to be pwned by a sneaky rat. Took the [stylus](http://openmoko.com/products-neo-base-00-stdkit.html) that came with the OpenMoko Kit, opened the front door for my furry friend to get out of my property. I switched on the torchlight + led laser thingy that comes with the stylus and pointed it right at the rat. Of course it was irritated but stayed put, and for a second, I thought I saw something moving by the front door. DAMN!. Another critter...I gave up, closed all doors and went to sleep...........

Now I got two rats somewhere in my house, watching over.....Remember next time you have a weird feeling, that schizophrenic experience, It must be the RATS...
