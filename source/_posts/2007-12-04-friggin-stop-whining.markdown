If you are a student, and pursuing an undergrad course in Computer Science, and if your friend comes and says, "Linux is not user friendly, Windows/Mac is...", hit them where it hurts and remind them, "You are an engineer and supposed to engineer stuff and make them work, not whine about them"..

....Works everytime
