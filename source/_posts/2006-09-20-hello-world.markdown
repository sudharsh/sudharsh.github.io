Howdie..At last dad gave me broadband connection...Its been tough without internet for 4 months. Right now I am working on ldtp stuff...Lets see how it goes. Apart from that my college is turning out to be a nightmare because of ECE dept.
Anyway..Any new stuff should be started off with 'Hello World' (I dont want to see what happens if we dont)
>>>print "Hello World..Welcome to my new blog"
