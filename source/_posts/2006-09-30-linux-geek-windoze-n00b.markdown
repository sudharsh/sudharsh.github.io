Now I dont call myself much of a linux geek, but atleast I know GNU/Linux more than some of the others.

Today By the way went to CRIS, Centre for Railways Information Systems, along with tuxmaniac to give a hands on training in [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org), & [CDT](http://www.eclipse.org/cdt).

techno_freak and Dr. Sreenivasan, both from [NRCFOSS](http://nrcfoss.org.in) accompanied us, since it was AU-KBC which was instrumental in organizing this event

This is where the fun starts. There were about 10 people for the event. All the boxes were running doze. We struggled installing CDT, of course its just a matter of extracting it correctly, but it was alien to us. I had never used doze as as primary OS  for a long long time, 1 year to be exact.

First stop, since CDT requires cygwin or Mingw32 to run, we had trouble configuring gcc, gdb to work properly with Eclipse. And the most frustrating was, the fact Eclipse forgot the changes we made to the environment variables and location of the gcc compilers everytime we restart or create a new project. Must be some bug, dunno.

After using all our neurons, and doing some hacks for about..hmmm an hour we dived into the topic, Of course the guys there helped us! tuxmaniac started off with slides about Eclipse and IDEs in general and then I showed installation, configuration and general working of Eclipse and CDT. After lunch, we came back and tuxmaniac started a session about debugging in gdb. We got really silly messages and wasted about half an hour, telling eclipse where gdb was located again and again..

tuxmaniac showed off aiglx on his dapper amidst ooohs and aaahs of the audience..Now thats an area I am comfortable..

All said, it was a nice experience as we were able to expose the people there to  eclipse and cdt at a basic level. Looks like they would contact us again, lets see.

But the best part was, the people themselves got to solve all the troubles with our help.. (yeah right)

Doesnt it jus show..Linux is user friendly..I missed my terminal for a whole day..Returning home I am dazed and swear that I am not gonna use doze again...
