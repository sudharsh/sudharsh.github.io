Went to kurukshetra o6 conducted by CEG today, It all started from a phone call from my close friend to have some fun there..We did!!

Anyways today was a Open Quiz, which I means everyone can participate. The prelims had questions which extracts juice from your grey matter and short circuits it..We did manage around 7-8 (totally embarassing) questions right. The finals had all the familiar quizzers battling against each other. (VV Ramanan, for one)

2 hours of intense quizzing was ..simply awesome. Although, poor Oscar Wilde was dragged in for all the wrong reasons which added colour and insanity to the event. Simply put, he was gay...Check the wikipedia article about him.

The OPC has been postponed to 14th, have told the organizers to send me the cash already..
