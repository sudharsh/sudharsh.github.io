Went for an industrial visit to HCL technologies near Pondycherry,

Its an assembly line where they assemble Desktops, Notebooks and Servers (the last ones made me cry...)

A kind lady led us through the entire assembly line. The tour lasted for 45 minutes..It was kinda cool actually with all the peripherals and juicy stuff lying around..I tried to nick a server board, but it was too large and I gave up..Got some nuts and bolts though...:)

The desktop assembly line was pretty obvious, motherboards, replications and all..

The servers were a whole new story..They showed us a monster of a machine with some 8 - 10 hot swappable HD, huge gigs of RAM, and a Cabinet that looked like a small refrigerator..8 lakhs was the price..(Started saving for it ASAP)...Oh and btw the fact that customers wanted Linux in these machines didnt come out as a surprise..

And not to mention some slick notebooks.. All these guys testing these stuff out made me kinda jealous.
So in a 14 hour trip if 2 hours were spent for I V, what happened to the remaining time?...Would like to remind you that we went to Pondy, Take the hint...:)

Returned home really late...
